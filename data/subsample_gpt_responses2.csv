0,Euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti,"The identified threats for Euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti, as provided in the text, include:

1. Incompatible Grazing by Large Ungulates: Grazing by large ungulates (such as cattle or deer) can damage the habitat critical to the survival of the Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly. Incompatible grazing can lead to the destruction of host plants necessary for larval development and nectar sources vital for adult butterflies.

2. Recreation: Activities associated with recreation, including the development of recreational infrastructure and increased human presence, can lead to habitat degradation or fragmentation, disturbing the critical habitats of this butterfly.

3. Invasive and Nonnative Plants: The invasion of nonnative plant species can alter the habitat by competing with native flora for resources. This includes the host and nectar plants essential for the life cycle of Euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti.

4. Climate Change: Climate change and its associated impacts such as drought and altered precipitation regimes can modify the habitat and its suitability for the Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly. This may include changes in the availability of host and nectar plants, and shifts in the timing of life cycle events (phenological shifts).

5. Altered Fire Regime: Changes in the natural fire regime, due to suppression or increased fire frequency/intensity, can alter habitat conditions. This may involve changes to the landscape that affect the availability and distribution of host and nectar plants.

These threats can have significant impacts on the habitat and survival of Euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti, necessitating special management considerations or protection to mitigate these threats as articulated in the proposed designation of critical habitat."
1,Ptychobranchus subtentus,"The identified threats for Ptychobranchus subtentus (Fluted Kidneyshell) from the text include:

1. **Habitat Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment**: The construction of several large impoundments from 1913 to 1976 inundated many river miles within the species' range, rendering habitats in these reaches unsuitable for the Fluted Kidneyshell and severing connectivity between the remaining occupied reaches. This historical event has significantly shaped the current distribution and fragmented the distribution of the Fluted Kidneyshell into isolated populations.

2. **Ongoing Activities Leading to Habitat Degradation**: Activities such as gravel and coal mining, urban development, and agriculture continue to degrade habitat within the species' range by contributing sediment and chemical contaminants to streams and by physically altering stream channels and riparian habitat.

3. **Vulnerability of Fragmented and Isolated Populations**: The fragmented and isolated distribution of current Fluted Kidneyshell populations leaves them vulnerable to extirpation.

4. **Climate Change**: Climate change is likely to adversely affect the Fluted Kidneyshell by altering hydrologic cycles and temperature regimes, though the extent or magnitude of this threat has not been quantified at the time of the text.

5. **Disease and Pathogens**: While disease was not identified as a substantial threat at the time of listing, research suggests that pathogens or other causal agents (e.g., bacteria, parasites) contributed to poor mussel health leading to annual mussel die-offs in the Clinch River beginning in 2016. A novel densovirus (Clinch densovirus 1) was epidemiologically linked to morbidity in Clinch River mussels.

These threats contribute to the decline of P. subtentus, necessitating recovery efforts that focus on reducing these threats, enhancing habitat resilience, and implementing other conservation actions detailed in the recovery plan."
2,Obovaria subrotunda,"Clinch River watershed comprised actively managed pastureland, cropland, or cultivated forest land, and agricultural runoff is the leading source of impairment in the watershed (University of Tennessee 2012, p. 20).

These activities can result in habitat degradation primarily through erosion, sediments, and nutrient runoff into waterways, further impacting longsolid and round hickorynut habitats by altering water quality and substrate composition necessary for their survival and reproduction.

Resource Extraction
Resource extraction industries, including coal mining, oil and gas development, and hydraulic fracturing, are prevalent across the range of both species and have noted impacts on freshwater mussel populations:

- Longsolid: Coal mining, specifically mountaintop removal and valley fill, contributes to alterations in stream chemistry and benthic community structure in the Coal River watershed (Pond et al. 2008, p. 1451; Entrekin et al. 2015, p. 145).
- Longsolid and round hickorynut: Oil and gas development, including hydraulic fracturing, is a source of concern regarding water withdrawals from streams that may impact flow and levels necessary for mussel survival. Additionally, the disposal of fracturing fluids and produced water could result in chemical contamination of waterways.

Barriers and Altered Hydrology
The construction of dams and other barriers across streams and rivers impacts longsolid and round hickorynut populations by disrupting natural flow regimes, fragmenting habitats, altering water quality, and obstructing host fish movement necessary for mussel reproduction:

- Longsolid: The construction of dams on the Clinch, Powell, and Holston Rivers has led to the fragmentation of habitats and alteration of flow regimes, impacting mussel populations.
- Round hickorynut: Dams within the Ohio River basin have resulted in fragmented mussel populations, restricting gene flow and reducing resiliency against environmental stochastic events.

Invasive and Nonnative Species
The introduction of nonnative and invasive species into waterways can outcompete or prey upon native species, including mussels. In particular, the proliferation of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) poses a significant threat by directly attaching to and smothering native freshwater mussel species, which has been documented in areas such as the Mississippi River basin where round hickorynut populations exist.

Small Population Size and Isolation
The remaining small and isolated populations of longsolid and round hickorynut are particularly vulnerable to stochastic events, inbreeding depression, and limited genetic diversity resulting in decreased adaptive potential. Isolation due to habitat fragmentation by dams further exacerbates these vulnerabilities by limiting connectivity between populations and impeding gene flow.

In conclusion, habitat degradation from development, urbanization, agricultural activities, resource extraction, barriers, altered hydrology, invasive species, and the challenges associated with small and isolated populations are identified as primary threats contributing to the decline of longsolid and round hickorynut populations. These factors collectively impact the species' ability to maintain viable populations across their respective ranges."
3,Epioblasma metastriata,"Based on the provided text (which appears to be absent), I can't give specific threats directly from it. However, I can provide general information about the threats that face species like *Epioblasma metastriata*, a type of freshwater mussel.

Freshwater mussels, including species like *Epioblasma metastriata*, are among the most endangered groups of animals in North America. Their declines are attributed to multiple threats, including:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Degradation**: Alteration of river systems through damming, dredging, and channelization disrupts the natural flow and sediment distribution, crucial for the life cycle of freshwater mussels.

2. **Pollution**: Chemical pollutants from industrial discharges, agricultural runoff (pesticides, fertilizers), and urban runoff can be especially harmful to mussels. Heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, and emerging contaminants like pharmaceuticals and personal care products can accumulate in the water and sediment, affecting musselsâ€™ survival and reproduction.

3. **Climate Change**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can lead to altered water levels, flow regimes, and exacerbate other threats like pollution. Extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, can further impact freshwater mussels' habitats.

4. **Invasive Species**: Invasive species can outcompete native mussels for food and habitat, alter ecosystem dynamics, or introduce diseases and parasites. For example, the zebra and quagga mussels have significantly impacted native freshwater mussel populations in North America.

5. **Hydrological Changes**: Water withdrawal for agriculture, industry, and domestic use can reduce water levels, affecting the habitat availability for mussels. Altered flow regimes can also impact the lifecycle of mussels, including the dispersal of larvae.

6. **Disease and Parasites**: Emerging diseases and the spread of parasites can have significant impacts on mussel populations, especially for those already stressed by other threats.

Conservation of *Epioblasma metastriata* and similar species requires a comprehensive approach, addressing these threats through habitat protection and restoration, pollution control, legislation and policy, and raising public awareness about the importance of freshwater mussels and the ecosystems they inhabit."
4,Procaris hawaiana,"Based on the information provided, the identified threats for Procaris hawaiana, an anchialine pool shrimp, include:

1. **Habitat Degradation and Loss**: Possible impacts from human activities or natural events that lead to the destruction, modification, or impairment of the anchialine pool habitats where Procaris hawaiana is found.

5. **Insufficient Breeding or Reproductive Areas**: The reduction or loss of suitable areas for breeding and reproduction due to environmental changes or human activities.

6. **Lack of Protection**: Although not explicitly stated, a lack of regulatory protection or conservation efforts specifically targeting Procaris hawaiana and its habitat could be an overarching threat by not addressing the factors leading to its decline.

It's important to note that while these threats can be inferred from the general recovery strategies mentioned for invertebrate species in the document and common conservation challenges for unique aquatic species like the anchialine pool shrimp, the original text does not explicitly list each of these threats specifically for Procaris hawaiana. Conservation efforts would need to address these in order to stabilize populations, protect habitats, and begin recovery processes."
5,Medionidus simpsonianus,"The provided text does not directly specify the threats to Medionidus simpsonianus (Ochlockonee Moccasinshell). To identify the threats to this species from the given text, one would need to access additional sections of the recovery plan or amendment that specifically address threats. This section mostly outlines the methodology used to update the recovery plan, including consultations with experts and review of new information, but does not detail the specific threats faced by the species. Threats could include habitat degradation, pollution, climate change, and other environmental or anthropogenic factors, but specific details would need to be sourced from other parts of the recovery plan documents or from the referenced research studies and survey data."
6,Faxonius eupunctus,"It seems that the text provided does not contain any information or context about the threats to Faxonius eupunctus, which is a species of crayfish. This could be due to a formatting error or an issue with the text input. However, I can provide some general threats that species like Faxonius eupunctus often face, which may help address your query:

1. **Habitat Destruction**: The degradation or loss of habitat due to human activities such as urbanization, agriculture, and industrial development is a significant threat. This can include the draining of wetlands, deforestation, and the construction of infrastructure like roads and damns.

3. **Climate Change**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect water levels, flow rates, and temperature, impacting crayfish habitats. Extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, can also pose direct threats to their populations.

4. **Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native crayfish species can lead to competition for food and space, and sometimes the displacement or decline of native crayfish populations like Faxonius eupunctus. Invasive species may also bring new diseases or parasites that native crayfish are not resistant to.

5. **Overharvesting**: In some regions, crayfish are harvested for food and bait, which can lead to population declines, especially when not managed sustainably.

To obtain specific threats faced by Faxonius eupunctus, one would need to consult scientific literature or conservation databases that focus on the status of this species."
7,Taylorconcha serpenticola,"The identified threats for **Taylorconcha serpenticola**, a mollusk species presumably mentioned in the context of the Snake River Aquatic Species Recovery Plan, include:

1. **Habitat Fragmentation and Alteration**: The transformation of the Snake River ecosystem from a primarily free-flowing, cold-water system to a slower-moving and warmer system has affected the habitat of aquatic species, including Taylorconcha serpenticola. Changes due to exploration, development, and the construction of dams have fragmented and altered their natural habitats.

2. **Deteriorating Water Quality**: Declining water quality in the Snake River has been a significant threat to the species. Factors contributing to water quality issues include pollution from agricultural runoff, urban development, and possibly other sources that increase turbidity and decrease oxygen levels, impacting Taylorconcha serpenticola's survival.

3. **Competition and Predation by Non-native Species**: The introduction of non-native flora and fauna can outcompete native species for resources and, in some cases, directly prey on them. While the plan does not specify which non-native species are problematic, it notes the importance of evaluating their effects on the listed species.

4. **Reduced Flow and Water Level Changes**: The stabilization of the Snake River Plain aquifer to protect discharge levels is crucial. Changes in water flow and levels, often caused by water extraction for agriculture and other uses, can affect the habitats of spring-associated species like Taylorconcha serpenticola by reducing the cold-water spring flows they rely on.

5. **Development and Habitat Degradation**: Actions needed include protecting cold-water spring habitats from further degradation through diversions, pollution, and development. This implies that such factors have been threats to Taylorconcha serpenticola by either directly destroying habitats or altering their conditions to levels that are no longer conducive to the species' survival.

The recovery plan emphasizes the need for habitat protection and restoration, water quality improvement, and ensuring stable water flows to address these threats and recover the populations of Taylorconcha serpenticola, among other listed snail species in the Snake River area."
8,Cumberlandia monodonta,"The identified threats to **Cumberlandia monodonta** (Spectaclecase mussel) based on the given text include:

1. **Water Quality:** Issues stemming from metals, nutrients, and major ions; organic compounds and contaminants of emerging concern; chemical controls used on invasive species that may also impact native mussels.

2. **Sedimentation:** The accumulation of sediments in water bodies can bury mussel habitats, reducing habitat quality and availability.

3. **Water Temperature:** Alterations in water temperature can impact the survival, reproduction, and distribution of the Spectaclecase mussel.

4. **Dissolved Oxygen:** Low levels of dissolved oxygen can be detrimental to the mussels, affecting their respiration and overall health.

5. **Hydrological Regime:** Changes in drought patterns, prolonged stream drying, inundation, and increased flashiness (rapid changes in water level and flow velocity) can adversely affect the Spectaclecase mussel.

6. **Connectivity:** Fragmentation of aquatic habitats can isolate populations, impacting gene flow and reducing population viability.

7. **Invasive Species:** Several invasive species pose threats, including Zebra Mussels (*Dreissena polymorpha*), Asian Clam (*Corbicula fluminea*), various invasive carps, Rusty Crayfish (*Faxoniusrusticus*), Spiny Water Flea (*Bythotrephes longimanus*), Brown Trout (*Salmo trutta*), and Quagga Mussel (*Dreissenarostriformis bugensis*).

8. **Mussel Disease:** Diseases can impact populations, reducing fitness and survival rates.

9. **Potential Catastrophic Events:** Events such as spills, extreme weather, or other sudden disasters can rapidly decimate populations.

These threats impact Cumberlandia monodonta by affecting their viability, habitat quality, reproductive success, and overall population resilience. Given the mussel's sensitivity to environmental changes, concerted conservation efforts addressing these threats are crucial for its survival."
9,Cambarus aculabrum,"Based on the information provided, there are no specified threats for Cambarus aculabrum identified in the text. To give a comprehensive answer on the threats to Cambarus aculabrum, a critically endangered species of crayfish typically found in specific regions of the United States, it is necessary to look at scientific literature and conservation reports. Common threats to such species, however, often include habitat destruction or modification (such as from development or agricultural expansion), water pollution, competition with or predation by invasive species, and changes in hydrology or water availability. Further details would require access to the original text or additional context."
10,Triodopsis platysayoides,"The identified threats for Triodopsis platysayoides, based on the five-factor analysis, are as follows:

1. **Factor A - Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat or range:**
   - **Recreation:** Increased recreational use, particularly in Cooper's Rock State Forest, poses a threat through potential reduction of leaf litter (vital for the snail's habitat), direct crushing of snails by visitors, and increased risk of wildfire due to human activities. Newly installed trails such as the Underlook Trail have also brought visitors closer to snail habitats, with high evidence of off-trail activity that could negatively impact the snails.
   - **Fire:** Wildfires pose a significant threat to the snail's habitat by potentially killing individuals and significantly reducing leaf litter. The management interest in increasing prescribed burns, though not directly aimed at snail habitats, raises concerns about potential impacts.
   - **Timber Harvesting:** Timber harvesting, particularly on private lands, poses a threat, although current practices include a standard 150-ft buffer around potential snail habitat during operations. However, the effectiveness and implementation of these buffers may vary.
   - **Coal Mining:** While not extensively detailed in the threats assessment, the mining rights for areas within Cheat Canyon WMA and partially within Snake Hill WMA are owned by private entities. Development of coal, limestone, and natural gas resources could destroy or damage snail habitats and their ecosystem.

2. **Factor B - Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes:** This factor was not identified as a relevant threat in the reviewed document.

3. **Factor C - Disease or predation:** While not explicitly mentioned in the reviewed portion, predation or disease could be potential threats, especially if altered by human impacts or environmental changes affecting the snail's predators or pathogens.

4. **Factor D - The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms:** The review acknowledges efforts by WVDNR and other state management to protect the snail's habitat, particularly in public lands. However, it notes that mineral rights for certain areas being owned by private entities could pose a threat due to potential development activities.

5. **Factor E - Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence:** Climate change and its potential to alter the snail's habitat, for example, by affecting humidity levels and temperature, could pose a threat. Additionally, human-induced changes such as introduction of invasive species or pollutants could also impact the snail's habitat quality and availability.

Overall, the primary identified threats revolve around habitat destruction or modification due to human recreational activities, potential development from mining rights, changes in land use such as timber harvesting, and wildfire risks. Efforts to mitigate these threats likely depend on a combination of regulatory protection, habitat management, and monitoring of population trends and habitat conditions."
11,Medionidus parvulus,"Based on the information provided in the text (which appears to be missing), I can offer insights into the threats typically faced by species like Medionidus parvulus, assuming it is a mollusk species, perhaps a freshwater mussel given the name.

For mollusk species such as freshwater mussels, including those belonging to the genus Medionidus, common threats include:

1. **Habitat Loss and Degradation:** This can result from various factors, including urban development, agricultural practices, and dam construction, which can alter water flow, sediment deposition, and the overall quality of the habitat.

2. **Water Pollution:** Chemical pollutants, agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers, and waste discharge from industries and urban areas can severely affect water quality and the health of mussel populations.

3. **Invasive Species:** The introduction of non-native species can compete for food or habitat, introduce diseases, or directly prey on native mussels.

4. **Climate Change:** Changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events can alter aquatic ecosystems, affecting the survival and reproduction of freshwater mussels.

5. **Overharvesting:** While perhaps less of a threat for some species than others, the collection for the pet trade, jewelry, and other human uses can impact certain mollusk populations.

6. **Diseases and Parasites:** Emerging diseases and parasites can impact populations, especially when combined with other stressors like pollution or habitat loss.

Each of these threats can individually or collectively contribute to the decline of species such as Medionidus parvulus. Addressing these challenges often requires comprehensive conservation strategies tailored to the specific needs and threats faced by the species in their natural habitats."
12,Epioblasma othcaloogensis,"Based on the text provided, there are no identified threats for Epioblasma othcaloogensis mentioned. To provide an accurate assessment of the threats to this species, typically listed under factors such as habitat loss, pollution, climate change, or overexploitation, I would need relevant contextual information or a detailed passage discussing its conservation status and threats. If you have specific details or excerpts, please share them, and I can give a more targeted response."
13,Texamaurops reddelli,"The identified threats for Texamaurops reddelli, as mentioned in the document, are primarily associated with the challenges facing its habitat in Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. These threats include:

1. **Land Development**: As these species are endemic to karst formations (caves, sinkholes, and other subterranean voids) in specific county areas, the expansion of urban or agricultural development poses a significant threat. Such development can lead to the destruction or severe alteration of their unique underground habitats.

2. **Pollution**: Pollution, which can stem from a variety of sources including urban runoff, agricultural runoff, and improper waste disposal, can infiltrate cave systems and significantly degrade the quality of the habitat. Pollutants can directly harm these species or affect the availability and quality of their food sources.

3. **Vandalism**: Human intrusion into cave systems, whether for recreational caving, deliberate vandalism, or other purposes, can directly harm these species. Such activities can lead to habitat destruction, alteration of cave microclimates (temperature and humidity), and disturbance or eradication of these sensitive creatures and their food sources.

4. **Red Imported Fire Ants (Solenopsis invicta)**: The incursion of red imported fire ants into the habitats of karst invertebrates like Texamaurops reddelli presents a formidable predation threat. These invasive ants are known to prey upon a wide range of species, including ground-dwelling invertebrates. Their presence in or near cave systems could lead to a significant decline in the populations of endemic karst invertebrates due to predation."
14,Pleurobema georgianum,"Based on the provided text (assuming no specific information was given), I cannot directly identify threats to Pleurobema georgianum, commonly known as the Georgia pigtoe mussel. However, drawing from general knowledge of threats faced by freshwater mussels, I can outline typical concerns that could potentially apply to Pleurobema georgianum.

Freshwater mussels, including species like Pleurobema georgianum, face a variety of threats, including but not limited to:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Alteration**: Destruction or modification of natural habitats through activities like dam construction, dredging, and the development of waterfronts can significantly impact these mussels. Changes in water flow, sedimentation patterns, and loss of riverbank vegetation can negatively affect their survival.

2. **Pollution**: Water pollution due to agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and urban stormwater can introduce toxins, reduce oxygen levels, and otherwise degrade the quality of the water in which these mussels live. Pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants can harm these organisms directly or indirectly by affecting their food sources.

3. **Climate Change**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect river and stream flows, potentially disrupting the habitats of freshwater mussels. Increased frequency of extreme weather events, like floods and droughts, can also impact mussel populations by altering their environments.

4. **Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can have various negative impacts on native mussels. For example, invasive zebra mussels have been known to attach to the shells of native mussels, impeding their ability to move, feed, and breathe, ultimately leading to the native mussels' death.

5. **Overharvesting**: Although not as common today due to legal protections, historical overharvesting for their shells (used in the button industry, for example) has significantly impacted mussel populations.

6. **Limited Mobility and Reproduction Challenges**: Freshwater mussels have limited mobility and rely on specific conditions and host fish species for the successful dispersal of their larvae. Changes that affect the availability of these fish hosts, such as overfishing or changes in water temperature, can therefore significantly impact mussel reproduction and survival.

Without the specific text, these threats are general considerations and may or may not apply directly to Pleurobema georgianum. Conservation efforts for any mussel species, including Pleurobema georgianum, need to consider and address these threats to improve population stability and ecosystem health."
15,Vetericaris chaceorum,"were occupied at the time of listing are 

limited and may not provide sufficient 

habitat for recovery, including space for 

population expansion. Additionally, the 

effects of climate change and the 

increased frequency and severity of 

fires, hurricanes, and drought may 

change the suitability of habitats that 

are currently occupied by these species. 

To ensure the conservation of these 

species and support the full life-history 

needs of each species, additional 

populations in areas outside the 

geographical area occupied by the 

species at the time of listing will need to 

be established. 

The best available data, which include 

recovery needs of the species, speciesâ€™ 

habitat needs throughout their life cycle, 

and speciesâ€™ historical range 

complemented by expert opinion, 

indicate that establishing additional 

populations is necessary to conserve 

these species. Therefore, we are 

proposing unoccupied areas as critical 

habitat for these species because we 

find that these areas are essential for the 

conservation of the species and that 

designation limited to those areas 

currently occupied would be inadequate 

to ensure the conservation of the 

species. We have determined, for each 

species, that the unoccupied areas we 

are proposing as critical habitat provide 

one or more of the physical or biological 

features essential to the conservation of 

the species. 

In summary, we are proposing to 

designate critical habitat in areas within 

the geographical area occupied by each 

species at the time of listing, except for 

Schiedea hawaiiensis, for which we are 

proposing to designate only unoccupied 

areas. For eight of the species, we are 

also proposing to designate specific 

areas outside the geographical area

determination that establishing 

additional populations outside the 

currently occupied areas is essential for 

the conservation of the species."
16,Medionidus penicillatus,"The identified threats for *Medionidus penicillatus*, also known as the Gulf moccasinshell, along with other endangered and threatened mussels discussed in the text, relate mainly to their habitat and conditions essential for their survival. Here's a summary based on the key points in the information provided:

1. **Habitat Degradation and Loss**: The loss and alteration of natural habitats due to various human activities pose significant threats. These may include construction, pollution, agricultural runoff, and impoundment effects that alter natural water flow and quality.

2. **Pollution**: Water and substrate quality degradation through various contaminants from point and non-point sources, including pesticides, heavy metals, and excessive nutrients, can adversely affect mussel populations. Wastewater discharges, even those in compliance with permits, can contribute to a cumulative effect that degrades habitat quality.

3. **Hydrological Changes**: Alterations in natural water flow regimes due to dam operations, water withdrawals for municipal and industrial uses, and modifications for flood control can significantly impact habitat conditions necessary for the mussels' life cycles.

4. **Sedimentation**: Changes in sediment transport dynamics, often exacerbated by upstream impoundments and land use changes, can lead to either sediment accumulation or erosion in mussel habitats, affecting their ability to survive and reproduce.

5. **Efficiency of Reservoirs in Sediment Trapping**: While some comments suggested that impoundments might benefit mussels by trapping sediments, the broader implications indicate that they rather lead to habitat fragmentation and loss, potentially eliminating mussels from extensive sections of rivers.

6. **Drought and Water Management Policies**: The effects of drought, compounded by water management policies that may not always prioritize ecological needs, can reduce water availability and habitat suitability for mussels.

7. **Agricultural Practices**: Certain agricultural practices and water use can indirectly affect mussel habitats through alterations in water quality and quantity.

8. **Need for Special Management**: Some areas, such as Swift Slough, are indicated to require special management due to sediment accumulation leading to intermittent flow, which deviates from the permanently flowing water condition needed by the mussels.

9. **Recovery Plan Goals**: The necessity to expand protected areas into historically occupied habitats for species recovery, alongside current conservation measures within designated critical habitats, highlights the extensive threat spectrum these species face across their ranges.

Each of these factors aligns with critical habitat components and threats identified in the regulation process aimed at protecting these mussels. Significant effort is required not just in protecting known habitats but also in studying potentially suitable but currently unoccupied or altered habitats for their conservation and eventual recovery."
17,Speyeria zerene myrtleae,"The identified threats for Speyeria zerene myrtleae, based on the provided text, fall under the five major categories as outlined by section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act. These include:

1. **Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification or Curtailment of Habitat or Range (Factor A):**  
   - Development of habitats into golf courses, residential areas, or other forms of urban development, especially on private lands near the Point Reyes National Seashore which could significantly diminish available habitat for the Myrtleâ€™s silverspot butterfly.
   - Increased foot traffic and recreational activities leading to potential trampling of larval stages and host plants, though this threat is currently considered minimal.

2. **Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes (Factor B):**
   - Illegal collection and poaching of the Myrtleâ€™s silverspot butterfly for private collectors or the international market, which poses a significant threat, especially given the high value of adult specimens in these markets.

3. **Disease or Predation (Factor C):**
   - This factor is mentioned, but the available information does not identify specific diseases or predators posing a significant threat to the Myrtleâ€™s silverspot butterfly as of the review. It remains an unknown area needing further investigation.
   
4. **Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms (Factor D):**
   - While the Endangered Species Act provides a degree of protection, challenges remain in fully protecting the Myrtleâ€™s silverspot butterfly from threats such as development, illegal collection, and habitat destruction. Specific inadequacies were not detailed beyond this general concern.

5. **Other Natural or Man-Made Factors Affecting its Survival (Factor E):**
   - Although not explicitly outlined in the provided text, this category typically includes threats such as climate change, competition or predation by non-native species, and stochastic events. The information does hint at issues like habitat isolation, increasing dominance of invasive plant species, and potential impacts from climate via changes in fog patterns, although these are not detailed as current threats under Factor E.

Overall, the primary concerns for Speyeria zerene myrtleae's survival appear to center on the loss or modification of habitat due to development and recreational use, as well as the risk posed by illegal collection activities. While diseases, predation, and regulatory inadequacies are acknowledged, the information provided focuses more on habitat and direct human impacts as the critical threats facing the Myrtleâ€™s silverspot butterfly."

1. **Habitat Destruction through Private Development**: Initially considered the primary threat, habitat destruction due to private development activities was cited at the time of listing. Although the immediate threat has diminished because most habitat is on publicly protected lands, development remains a threat on privately owned habitats.

2. **Habitat Degradation via Public Infrastructure Projects**: Such projects were considered the most serious threat in a previous status review, indicating that activities associated with infrastructure development and maintenance could degrade the butterfly's habitat.

3. **Loss of Habitat Due to Succession**: The natural succession of habitat can lead to the loss of the specific conditions required by the San Bruno elfin butterfly, impacting its populations.

4. **Poaching**: Illegal collection or disturbance of the species can directly reduce population sizes.

5. **Parasitism and Predation of Larvae**: These natural processes can negatively impact larval survival rates, potentially reducing the number of individuals reaching adulthood.

6. **Small Population Size**: Small populations are more vulnerable to extinction due to their limited genetic diversity and reduced ability to cope with environmental changes.

7. **Native and Exotic Plant Invasions**: The invasion of non-native plant species can alter habitat conditions, making them unsuitable for the butterfly and its host plants. This also includes the impacts of native plants that may compete with the butterfly's host plants.

8. **Climate Change**: Changing climate conditions can affect the butterfly's habitat and the phenology of its host plants, potentially leading to mismatches in the timing of butterfly emergence and the availability of necessary food sources.

9. **Pesticide Use**: The use of pesticides can directly harm butterflies and larval stages or indirectly impact them by destroying their host plants or the nectar sources available for the adults.

10. **Accidental Damage to Habitat during Population Monitoring**: Activities related to monitoring the butterfly's populations, if not carefully managed, can inadvertently damage habitat and host plants. 

These threats suggest that the conservation of the San Bruno elfin butterfly depends on continued protection of its habitat, careful monitoring of population trends, and efforts to manage and mitigate the identified threats."
20,Medionidus acutissimus,"conditions, and perhaps allow 

expansion of the surviving populations 

into newly suitable habitat. This 

designation will not specifically 

request or require an increase in flows 

from Weiss Dam, but will alert Federal 

agencies to consider such actions in 

future consultations. 
Issue G: Comments on Effects of 
Designation 
(56) 
Comment: 
The proposed 
designation will prevent issuance of 404 

permits for activities such as housing 

developments, small business 

expansions, road improvements, and 

bank stabilization. 
Response: 
The Act requires Federal 
agencies to consult with us on actions 

that may affect listed species or their 

critical habitats. Therefore, issuance of 

404 permits under the Clean Water Act 

by the USACE are subject to section 7 

consultation requirements with regard 

to listed species, regardless of critical 

habitat designation. Most of the 

activities listed above are not typically 

conducted in the stream channel and 

have little or negligible effect on the 

channel. For those activities that may 

directly affect the channel (
e.g.
, 
bridge 
construction, bank stabilization, etc.), 

consultations to avoid jeopardy to listed 

species are already required. These 

consultations have typically required 

the use of standard Best Management 

Practices and minimization of 

activities during critical periods of 
mussel reproduction. We do not 

anticipate that the designation of critical 

habitat will result in additional burdens 

or requirements to obtain 404 permits. 
(57) 
Comment: 
Flood relief projects 
may not be possible because of 

consultations resulting from critical 

habitat regulations. 
Response: 
Critical habitat designation 

will not prevent flood relief projects. 

Section 7 consultations will continue to 

ensure that Federal actions and 

activities do not adversely modify critical 

habitat, and are typically concluded 

with minimal modifications to the 

action. Informed planning and project 

development that considers the 

conservation needs of listed species and 

their critical habitats allows Federal 

agencies the ability to conduct their 

actions while conserving endangered or 

threatened freshwater mussels and their 

habitat.
(58) 
Comment: 
Existing management 
practices in forestry, grazing, row crop 

agriculture, and pecan farming may be 

eliminated due to designation of critical 

habitat. 
Response: 
The land practices listed 

above are not typically conducted in the 

designated stream channel or within 

critical habitat, and are already subject 

to Best Management Practices to 

minimize their impacts to the stream 

channel. Critical habitat designation 

does not affect private land activities 

that do not involve a Federal action. 
(59) 
Comment: 
The proposed 
designation will cause activities such as 

wildlife food plots and bays to be 

delayed or cancelled. 
Response: 
Activities such as wildlife 

food plots and bays typically are 

enhancements conducted for the 

conservation of wildlife. Although we 

cannot anticipate all actions that some 

may think will be affected by critical 

habitat designation, we encourage the 

continued improvement and protection 

of habitats consistent with the 

conservation of these listed mussels and 

their stream and river habitats. 

Activities that specifically improve the 

stream channel or habitat for listed 

species or maintain current condition or 

management of the habitat are usually 

not subject to section 7 consultation 

requirements."
21,Hesperia dacotae,"Based on the provided text, the identified threats to the Dakota Skipper (Hesperia dacotae) include:

1. **Habitat Loss and Degradation**: The complete removal of its native prairie habitat and its replacement with row-crop agriculture has been a significant threat. Degradation of habitat due to recurring intensive livestock grazing, the encroachment of invasive plant species, and unsustainable mortality caused by prescribed fire and insecticide use also pose significant threats.

2. **Climate Change**: Climate change is implied as a threat, particularly in the context of potential shifts to wetter and warmer conditions across the speciesâ€™ range. Such changes could increase the threat posed by invasive cool-season grasses, altering the prairie ecosystems that support Dakota Skippers.

3. **Pesticide Use**: The use of pesticides is specifically mentioned as a threat that can directly impact the Dakota Skipper populations, potentially through effects on mortality rates and habitat quality.

4. **Management Practices**: Certain land management practices such as burning, haying, and grazing regimes are identified as influencing Dakota Skipper populations both positively and negatively. These practices can affect the quality of habitat and the integrity of plant communities crucial for the species' survival.

5. **Flooding**: While not detailed extensively, flooding is listed among the factors considered in the analysis, suggesting it can impact the species' populations, likely through habitat alteration or destruction.

6. **Habitat Fragmentation and Isolation of Populations**: The text indicates that fragmentation and isolation reduce connectivity among populations, potentially affecting genetic diversity and limiting the capacity for recolonization following local extinctions.

7. **Other Risk Factors**: Other general threats include prairie conversion to non-natural uses and catastrophic drought, although specific details on their impacts on Dakota Skipper were not fully elaborated.

8. **Lack of Habitat Management**: A lack of appropriate habitat management can lead to habitat degradation, again pointing toward the critical role that habitat quality plays in the survival of this species.

These identified threats highlight the complexity of factors impacting the Dakota Skipper, emphasizing the importance of multifaceted conservation strategies that address habitat preservation and restoration, management of land use practices, and considerations of the broader ecological impacts of climate change and pesticide use."
22,Erinna newcombi,"The identified threats for Erinna newcombi (Newcomb's Snail) include:

1. **Predation by red-crested cardinals (Paroaria coronata)**: These birds were observed feeding on freshwater snails along the Hanakoa stream in 2015, leading to a significant drop in observed individuals of E. newcombi from fifty to none at this location.

2. **Impact of Climate Change**: E. newcombi, inhabiting specialized habitats at the edge of streams, is highly susceptible to impacts from climate change. This encompasses mainly the increase in the frequency and duration of drier periods, as well as rising instances of flooding events that can exterminate native plant species along streams, paving the way for invasive species to take over, which poses another significant threat to the snail's habitat.

3. **Invasive Plant Species**: The presence of invasive plants at sub-population locations of E. newcombi poses a threat to the species by altering its natural habitat.

4. **Non-native Lymnaeids, Flatworms, and Other Parasites**: These are considered as under-studied threats to E. newcombi, potentially impacting its health and population numbers.

5. **Other Animals**: Goats (Capra hircus), rats (Rattus spp.), marsh flies, pigs (Sus scrofa), and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) remain ongoing threats to E. newcombi, potentially through habitat destruction, predation, or competition for resources.

In light of these threats, the review suggests that Newcombâ€™s snail continues to meet the criteria for a species considered ""threatened"" as it is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range."
23,Apodemia mormo langei,"The identified threats for Apodemia mormo langei (Lange's metalmark butterfly) as outlined in the text include:

1. **Habitat Degradation**: Over the last 150 years, the dune habitat at Antioch Dunes was significantly degraded due to sand removal, the invasion of non-native plants, and recreational use. This degradation impacts the quality and availability of habitat necessary for the survival of Lange's metalmark butterfly, particularly affecting its host plant, the naked stem buckwheat (Eriogonum nudum var. auriculum).

2. **Invasive Non-native Plants**: The overgrowth of invasive, non-native plants has been a significant problem, as these species can outcompete the native plants critical for the butterfly's lifecycle, such as its host plant.

3. **Limited Range and Population Fragmentation**: The butterfly is endemic to the Antioch Dunes of Contra Costa County, California, and the only known extant populations inhabit the Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge. This limited range, compounded by habitat fragmentation, makes the species particularly vulnerable to extinction.

4. **Insufficient Information for Recovery Criteria Development**: At the time of the recovery plan's writing, there was not enough information regarding the species' population trends and stability, which resulted in a lack of specific, measurable recovery criteria. This lack creates a challenge in assessing recovery efforts and threats effectively.

Though the text does not explicitly list these aspects as ""threats"" in a dedicated section, they can be inferred from descriptions of the butterfly's status, habitat, and issues impacting its conservation. The emphasis on implementing recovery actions such as protection of the Antioch Dunes ecosystem, habitat restoration, and public education indirectly highlights the species' threats. The decline in population despite a significant percentage of recovery actions being implemented underscores the ongoing and possibly evolving nature of the threats facing Apodemia mormo langei."
24,Optioservus phaeus,"The identified threats for *Optioservus phaeus* (Scott Riffle Beetle) include:

1. **Groundwater Depletion**: The future viability of the Scott Riffle Beetle is significantly threatened by groundwater withdrawal from the High Plains Aquifer. Depletion and recharge rates, influenced by regional water usage and climate change, pose a critical risk, leading to potential loss of the essential spring ecosystem where the larvae and adults complete their life cycles. Groundwater withdrawals threaten the fundamental environmental factors critical to the beetle's habitat in Big Spring, the beetle's only known location. 

2. **Anthropogenic Activities**: While currently minimized due to protective measures at Big Spring, anthropogenic stressors such as habitat destruction, surface water contamination, substrate removal, and the introduction of invasive species could pose future threats if these protective measures are not maintained or if there are increases in these activities.

These threats impact the beetle's habitat and survival by potentially altering:
- The consistency of groundwater discharge, critical for maintaining the spring ecosystem.
- Water quality, particularly affecting the required unpolluted, oxygenated, and shallow aquatic conditions the beetle needs.
- The physical substrate of the habitat, which should include medium-sized rocks or broken concrete for the beetles to thrive.
- The abundance of aquatic macrophytes, algae, and periphyton, serving as food sources.
- The availability of adjacent terrestrial habitats, which are necessary for part of the beetle's life cycle.

Given these threats, the SSA report also outlines potential conservation efforts and future scenarios, ranging from optimistic to pessimistic based on groundwater usage levels, contamination risks, habitat protection measures, and the establishment of a captive population or suitable rearing facilities. These efforts aim at maintaining or ideally increasing the beetle's resilience, redundancy, and representation to ensure its long-term viability."
25,Pleurobema taitianum,"Based on the lengthy text provided, the identified threats for **Pleurobema taitianum** (Heavy Pigtoe) are largely twofold:

1. **Recruitment Failure**: According to the synthesis, since its listing, all third-order stream populations of Heavy Pigtoe have become extirpated, and a single surviving population in the Alabama River appears to have experienced recruitment failure. Here, recruitment failure means a lack of new individuals growing to adulthood within the population. No evidence of recruitment was detailed when discussing the condition of remaining Heavy Pigtoe in the Alabama River. The small number of Heavy Pigtoes, all mature adults without evidence of younger individuals, flags a severe threat to the species' long-term viability.

2. **Vulnerability to Catastrophic Events**: The document also points out that the single surviving population of Heavy Pigtoe is vulnerable to natural or human-induced random catastrophic events. Given that its entire known population is confined to a single location, any localized catastrophic event such as pollution, habitat destruction, or significant alteration of the river's hydrology could potentially wipe out the species.  

Additionally, while it is mentioned as a conservation option rather than a threat, the inability to successfully propagate Heavy Pigtoe for the purposes of conservation reintroduction suggests limitations in our current ability to mitigate the species' declining status through human intervention.

Other indirect or associated threats likely impacting Pleurobema taitianum, inferred from the broader context and individual species' summaries, include:

- **Habitat Degradation and Loss**: Alteration or destruction of river habitats, potentially from impoundments (dams or reservoirs) affecting the natural flow and quality of rivers, can severely impact mussel species including Heavy Pigtoe.
- **Pollution**: Given the documentation of non-point source pollution conservation measures for other species in the same document, water quality issues from agriculture, urban runoff, or point source pollution can be deduced as a broad threat affecting riverine species.
  
The document also shows a concerted effort toward the conservation of Pleurobema taitianum and similar species, including habitat conservation plans and partnerships aiming to protect and possibly recover populations. However, the species' situation seems precarious without evident signs of natural population recovery."
26,Pyrgulopsis turbatrix,"Based on the provided text, the identified threats for Pyrgulopsis turbatrix, also known as the southwest Nevada pyrg, are as follows:

1. **Predation and Competition:** The presence of invasive, non-native, and native species that prey on or compete with Pyrgulopsis turbatrix for resources poses a significant threat to its population and habitat stability.

2. **Vegetation and Soil Disturbance:** Activities such as road construction, wildfire, grazing and browsing by ungulates, and recreational activities lead to vegetation and soil disturbances that negatively impact the springsnails' habitat. These disturbances can alter the physical and biological characteristics of the habitats necessary for their survival.

3. **Water Pollution:** The introduction of pollutants from agricultural runoff, human development, and the use of herbicides contaminates the water sources where Pyrgulopsis turbatrix resides. Water pollution can lead to degraded water quality, affecting the health and viability of springsnail populations.

4. **Spring Modifications:** Human modifications to spring habitatsâ€”such as the alteration of spring flow for water diversion or development purposesâ€”can significantly impact the availability and quality of habitat for Pyrgulopsis turbatrix. These modifications often result in reduced or completely eliminated spring flow, negatively impacting the springsnail's ability to survive and reproduce.

5. **Groundwater Pumping and Diversion:** This activity threatens the future conditions of Pyrgulopsis turbatrix habitats by potentially reducing spring flow. Altered precipitation patterns and increased groundwater withdrawal for human use could lead to changes in spring discharge that may not support the springsnail populations.

6. **Climate Change:** Projected alterations in climate conditions, including changes in temperature and precipitation, pose long-term threats to the spring habitats by potentially reducing the availability of free-flowing water and adequate spring discharge required by Pyrgulopsis turbatrix. 

These threats, if unaddressed, could lead to reduced resilience, redundancy, and representation of the Pyrgulopsis turbatrix species, affecting its long-term viability in the wild."
27,Nicrophorus americanus,"The identified threats for Nicrophorus americanus (American Burying Beetle) as outlined in the Species Status Assessment Report are primarily:

1. **Habitat Impacts due to Land Use**: Changes and impacts on habitat caused by various forms of land use, including agricultural activities, urban expansion, and management practices that can lead to habitat loss, fragmentation, and alteration, affecting the beetle's survival and reproduction.

2. **Effects Related to Climate Change**: This includes temperature increases, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events, which can alter the habitats where the American Burying Beetle lives, the availability of carrion (which they need for breeding and feeding), and potentially expose the species to higher risks of extinction due to loss of resilient populations.

Other important factors affected by habitat loss or alteration include:

- **Availability of appropriately sized carrion for reproduction**, crucial for the beetles to breed successfully.
- **Soil moisture levels**, which can affect the feasibility of burial and breeding sites.

Both of these crucial factors for the species' survival are dependent on, or significantly impacted by, changes in land use and climate."
28,Alasmidonta atropurpurea,"Based on the provided textâ€”which appears to be missingâ€”the identification of specific threats to **Alasmidonta atropurpurea**, a species of freshwater mussel, cannot be explicitly outlined from the non-existing content. However, I can offer a general overview of common threats faced by freshwater mussels, including Alasmidonta atropurpurea, based on existing knowledge up to 2023:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Degradation**: Changes in land use, such as agricultural development, urbanization, mining, and construction activities, can lead to the destruction and degradation of suitable habitats for these mussels.

2. **Water Pollution**: Pollution from agricultural runoff (pesticides, fertilizers), industrial discharges, and untreated sewage can significantly affect water quality, impacting the survival of mussels.

3. **Sedimentation**: Increased sediment in water bodies, often resulting from deforestation, agriculture, and construction activities, can bury mussels and reduce the quality of their habitat.

4. **Dam Construction and River Modification**: The construction of dams and modification of river channels can alter water flow and sediment distribution, impact the availability of suitable habitats, and disrupt the life cycle of freshwater mussels.

5. **Climate Change**: Changing temperatures and precipitation patterns, as well as increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, can affect water levels, temperature, and flow regimes, which are critical for the survival and reproduction of freshwater mussels.

6. **Competition and Predation by Invasive Species**: Invasive species can compete with native mussels for food and habitat, and in some cases, predators introduced to new ecosystems can significantly impact populations of native mussels.

7. **Overharvesting**: Though less common today due to increased awareness and conservation efforts, historical collection of mussels for pearls, shell buttons, or as bait may have contributed to declines in some areas.

For specific threats to Alasmidonta atropurpurea, it's essential to refer to detailed studies or conservation assessments focusing on this particular species. Conservation strategies are often developed based on these identified threats to help preserve and recover populations of threatened freshwater mussels like Alasmidonta atropurpurea."
29,Habroscelimorpha dorsalis dorsalis,"Based on the provided text, the identified threats to Habroscelimorpha dorsalis dorsalis, also known as the Northeastern Beach Tiger Beetle (previously Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis), include:

1. **High Levels of Pedestrian Traffic:** This threat is particularly detrimental during the larval stage, which lasts for two years. The larvae live in vertical burrows in the beach intertidal zone, where they are highly vulnerable to disturbance.

2. **Off-Road Vehicles (ORVs):** The use of vehicles on their habitat beaches can lead to the destruction of larvae burrows and negatively impact the beetle's survival rates.

3. **Coastal Development:** Changes in the beach environment due to development can significantly alter the beetle's natural habitat, leading to a decline in population numbers.

4. **Beach Stabilization Structures:** These structures can cause changes to the natural erosion and accretion processes of beaches, affecting the dynamic ecosystem that the Northeastern Beach Tiger Beetle relies on.

5. **Limited Dispersal and Recruitment:** Although the adults have good dispersal abilities, the recruitment of new populations is hampered by the lack of nearby undisturbed beaches, reducing the species' ability to expand its range or recolonize areas.

6. **Reduction of Beach Ecosystems:** The overall decline in healthy, undisturbed beach ecosystems along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, due to intense coastal development and recreational use, has likely contributed to the species' decline. This includes the loss of habitat for other rare, beach-dwelling organisms, indicating broader ecosystem health issues.

7. **Historical Decline:** The historical decline of this species, from being described as occurring in ""great swarms"" along certain parts of the coast to being limited to only a few locations, underscores the significant impact of these threats over time.

The Recovery Plan aims to mitigate these threats through measures such as monitoring existing populations, protecting viable populations and their habitats, studying life history parameters, evaluating human impacts, and implementing management measures."
30,Antrobia culveri,"Based on the provided text, there are no specific details or context given about the threats to Antrobia culveri. The text consists mostly of placeholders and repeated mentions of Antrobia culveri without any substantial information about threats or any other aspect related to the species. To assess threats to Antrobia culveri, more detailed and specific information would be necessary, including environmental factors, anthropogenic pressures, or biological challenges the species might be facing."
31,Vetericaris chaceorum,"From the provided text, the identified threats to **Vetericaris chaceorum** (anchialine pool shrimp) include:

1. **Habitat Degradation and Loss**: The anchialine pools, where V. chaceorum resides, are highly susceptible to degradation from both natural and anthropogenic activities. These activities have ecologically degraded these unique habitats and drastically altered their native biota from pristine conditions. It is estimated that more than 90% of anchialine pools have been lost or degraded due to coastal development and the spread of exotic species.

2. **Urban Development**: Urban development is specifically mentioned as a contributing factor to the loss or degradation of the anchialine pool habitats. This kind of development likely alters the quality and accessibility of the habitat for V. chaceorum.

3. **Introduction of Non-native Species**: The spread of exotic species is highlighted as a threat, which could lead to competition for resources, predation, or diseases impacting V. chaceorum populations.

4. **Limited Distribution and Low Populations**: The text notes that V. chaceorum has only been documented in a few locations and estimates suggest there may be no more than a couple dozen individuals in some areas. This limited distribution and low population size make the species particularly vulnerable to extinction.

5. **Salinity Tolerance and Distribution**: V. chaceorum has never been found in pools with salinities below 15ppt, despite the accessibility of fresher waters at their habitat sites. This indicates that salinity plays a significant role in the distribution of V. chaceorum and suggests that changes in salinity (potentially from human activities or climate change) could impact these populations.

6. **Difficulties in Sampling and Observing Populations**: The text mentions the cryptic nature of the species and the difficulties in sampling large anchialine pools, complicating efforts to accurately assess population sizes and trends.

These threats together paint a picture of a species that is highly specialized to a unique habitat, making it particularly vulnerable to human-induced changes and natural habitat variability."
32,Cicurina madla,"Based on the provided text from the recovery plan for Bexar County Karst Invertebrates, the identified threats for Cicurina madla, along with other listed karst invertebrates, include:

1. **Habitat Destruction**: This is a primary threat where caves and karst habitats are completely filled with cement during development, impacted by quarrying activities, or by capping or sealing cave entrances.

2. **Alteration of Drainage Patterns and Surface Plant and Animal Communities**: Changes in these patterns and communities can affect the stability and quality of the cave ecosystems that Cicurina madla relies on.

3. **Edge Effects**: The interface between natural habitats and developed areas can introduce additional threats to these species, such as increased predation, competition, or invasion by non-native species.

4. **Contamination**: Pollution from surface activities can seep into cave systems, negatively affecting the delicate ecosystems within.

5. **Human Visitation and Vandalism**: Increased human activity can lead to habitat disturbance, degradation, and direct harm to species.

6. **Quarrying and Mining Operations**: These activities can lead to the destruction of karst habitats, either directly through excavation or indirectly through changes in water flow and quality.

7. **Small Population Size**: Many of these species, including Cicurina madla, are known only from a limited number of sites, making them particularly vulnerable to extinction from habitat loss or stochastic events.

8. **Climate Change**: Alterations in regional climate patterns can affect the temperature and humidity stability of cave systems, which these species rely on.

9. **Competition and Predation by Red-Imported Fire Ants**: These invasive ants can compete with cave crickets, an important food source for cave-dwelling invertebrates, and may also prey directly on the karst invertebrates themselves.

10. **Invasive Vegetation**: Non-native plant species can alter the native surface vegetation community, potentially reducing the amount of organic material entering cave systems and changing the microhabitats available.

The recovery plan emphasizes habitat protection, management, research, and education as key strategies to mitigate these threats and bolster the populations of Cicurina madla and other endangered karst invertebrates of Bexar County."
33,Lampsilis streckeri,"Without the specific text provided about Lampsilis streckeri, I can't directly reference threats mentioned in it. However, based on my knowledge up to September 2023, common threats to Lampsilis streckeri, a species of freshwater mussel, often include:

1. **Habitat Loss and Degradation**: This can be due to agricultural runoff, urbanization, deforestation, and dam construction. These activities can alter water flow, sediment deposition, and water quality, impacting the mussel's habitat.

2. **Pollution**: Chemical pollutants from industrial discharge, pesticides, and fertilizers can contaminate water bodies. Heavy metals and other toxic substances can be particularly harmful, affecting the musselâ€™s growth, reproduction, and survival.

5. **Disease**: Emerging infectious diseases can have significant impacts on freshwater mussels. These diseases can spread rapidly and decimate populations that have no immunity or resistance.

6. **Damming and Water Withdrawal**: Dams alter the natural flow of rivers, affecting the essential habitat features for mussels. Reduced water levels from withdrawal for human use can also contribute to habitat degradation.

To get the most current and accurate information on the threats to Lampsilis streckeri, consulting recent scientific research, conservation reports, or resources from environmental and governmental organizations dedicated to the conservation of freshwater mussels and their habitats would be advisable."
34,Lepidurus packardi,"The identified threats for Lepidurus packardi (Vernal Pool Tadpole Shrimp) based on this document are as follows:
 
1. **Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Habitat or Range (Factor A)**: The primary threat to Lepidurus packardi is the loss of habitat due to urban development, water supply/flood control activities, and conversion to agricultural use. This threat impacts the shrimpâ€™s ability to thrive as their ephemeral freshwater habitats, including alkaline pools, clay flats, vernal lakes, vernal pools, vernal swales, and other seasonal wetlands, are fragmented and destroyed.

2. **Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms (Factor D)**: Although there are efforts towards conservation and management plans, the existing regulatory mechanisms at the time of the review are not sufficient to fully protect the species and its habitat from ongoing threats. There are also concerns about the long-term efficacy of these mechanisms due to potential inadequacies in funding, personnel, and implementation.

3. **Other Man-made or Natural Factors Affecting its Continued Existence (Factor E)**: This includes threats from inappropriate management or restoration practices that do not consider the specific needs of the species, such as habitat management practices that do not control invasive plant species or adequately manage site hydrology. Additionally, there is concern about the genetic degradation of the species due to introductions conducted without systematic guidelines or supported by research, which may mix genetic attributes from occurrences that may be genetically distinct.

4. **Disease or Predation (Factor C)**: Not explicitly stated as a current threat in the document, but typically considered under general threats to small, isolated populations of endangered species. The review does mention hermaphroditic characteristics and multiple hatching within a wet season, which may imply concerns regarding genetic diversity and resilience against disease or predation.

5. **Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes (Factor B)**: This was not included as a threat in the listing rule and is not addressed in the Recovery Plan. There's no mentioned evidence suggesting that overutilization is a concern for this species.

Efforts towards habitat protection, management, and monitoring are highlighted as crucial for the conservation of Lepidurus packardi. However, the success of these efforts is dependent on the implementation of adequate recovery plans that address the aforementioned threats, along with continued research and monitoring to adapt and refine strategies for the species' recovery."

4. Habitat Loss and Degradation: Changes in land use, urbanization, and agricultural expansion contribute to the loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats for B. franklini.

5. Livestock Grazing: Grazing can alter the habitat structure and floral availability essential for B. franklini's foraging and nesting.

6. Climate Change: Shifts in climate can affect the distribution and quality of habitats, as well as the phenology of flowering plants critical for foraging.

7. Competition from non-native bees: Introduction and the prevalence of non-native bees can lead to competition for resources. 

Synergistic Effects: The combined effects of several stressors likely exacerbate declines in B. franklini populations, making it more challenging to address the threats they face comprehensively."
36,Gammarus pecos,"The identified threats to Gammarus pecos, based on the executive summary of the Species Status Assessment for Diamond Tryonia, Gonzales Tryonia, and Pecos Amphipod, include:

1. **Reduction of Water Quantity**: Declining groundwater levels driven by extensive groundwater pumping for various human uses (e.g., irrigation) threaten the spring flow essential for Gammarus pecos. Past and ongoing heavy extraction of water from the Rustler and Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifers, which support the spring system, has resulted in significant reductions in spring flow.

2. **Degradation of Water Quality**: The potential for contamination from various sources, including oil and natural gas operations, poses a risk to the habitat of Gammarus pecos. Operations related to oil and gas extraction, increased drilling, production, transportation, and processing activities could lead to petroleum or wastewater contaminant discharges, spills, and releases.

3. **Competition and Predation by Invasive Species**: The presence of non-native species, such as the invasive red-rim melania snail (Melanoides tuberculata), remains abundant in the spring system, posing a competitive threat to Gammarus pecos.

4. **Climate Change**: Anticipated increases in aridity and temperature due to anthropogenic climate change could further strain groundwater resources. Climate projections suggest rising temperatures, which could increase evaporation rates and decrease water availability, further stressing the aquatic habitats crucial for Gammarus pecos.

5. **Spring and CiÃ©nega Modification**: Human alteration and disturbance of spring habitats, though somewhat mitigated within the boundaries of protected areas like the Diamond Y Spring Preserve, remain a concern for the persistence of Gammarus pecos outside these areas.

6. **Groundwater Conservation and Management Policies**: Current groundwater management practices, including the principle of the rule of capture in Texas, do not suffice to protect spring flows essential for Gammarus pecos. Desired future conditions for aquifers do not include maintaining stable levels or spring flow volumes necessary for the survival of this species.

These threats are interrelated and compound the risk of habitat loss and degradation, which is a major concern for the long-term viability of Gammarus pecos. The Nature Conservancy's protective efforts within the Diamond Y Spring Preserve offer some degree of habitat preservation; however, they are not enough to fully mitigate these identified threats."
37,Speyeria callippe callippe,"Given the provided text, the identified threats for *Speyeria callippe callippe* include:

1. **Loss and Degradation of Habitat from Human Activities**: This is the primary threat at the time of listing, which continues to endanger the species. Activities include development and fragmentation of land, particularly on private land.

2. **Competition with Non-native Species**: The introduction and spread of non-native plant species in the callippe silverspot butterfly's habitat compete for resources with native plants that are essential for the butterfly's survival.

3. **Encroachment with Native Shrubs**: The overgrowth of native shrubs into grasslands impacts the availability of grassland habitat necessary for the species, limiting host and nectar plants used by the species as well as limiting larval movement.

4. **Fire**: Wildfires can significantly alter or destroy the habitat, making it unfavorable for the butterflies.

5. **Pesticide Use**: The application of pesticides can have harmful effects on butterfly populations, either through direct toxicity or through impacts on their food sources.

6. **Small Population Sizes**: The factors associated with small population sizes present a risk to the future viability of the species. Small populations are more vulnerable to demographic and environmental stochastic events, which can lead to further declines or extirpation.

Additionally, climate change is mentioned as a factor that is likely to change temperature, coastal fog, and precipitation levels in areas occupied by callippe silverspot butterflies, but the direct impact of these changes on the species is unclear. However, an increased chance of wildfire due to climate change might indirectly affect the species' viability."
38,Hesperia dacotae,"The identified threats to Hesperia dacotae (Dakota skipper) as outlined in the recovery plan include:

1. Loss of native prairie and degradation of remaining habitat patches due to various factors such as:
   - Conversion of native prairie for agriculture or urbanization.
   - Ecological succession of native prairie to habitats dominated by brush or trees.
   - Impacts from oil and gas development.
   - Invasive species.
   - Direct and indirect effects of pesticides, including herbicides.
   - Flooding.
   - Land management regimes (grazing, haying, or fire) if done in a way that degrades the speciesâ€™ habitat.

2. Threats from climate change which may lead to environmental conditions favoring invasive cool-season grasses, potentially further threatening the Dakota skipper habitat.

3. Mortality to vulnerable life stages caused by land management practices that are not well-suited to the speciesâ€™ conservation.

These threats contribute to habitat loss and fragmentation, hindering the ability of Dakota skipper populations to persist in their native prairie ecosystem. The recovery plan focuses on actions to mitigate these threats through habitat conservation, management, and restoration, along with population management strategies aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of the Dakota skipper."
39,Pleurobema athearni,"The identified threats for Pleurobema athearni (Canoe Creek Clubshell) include:

1. **Increased Sedimentation:** This is mainly attributed to land use within the Big Canoe Creek watershed. Sedimentation can smother the habitat mussels depend on, reducing food availability and the clean substrates needed for juvenile mussel survival.

2. **Declining Water Quality:** Decline in water quality can be due to various pollutants entering the water system. This could be from agricultural runoff, wastewater discharge, or other sources of pollution that affect the overall health of the water system where the Canoe Creek Clubshell resides.

3. **Inundation due to Impoundments on the Coosa River:** Impoundments or dams can alter the natural flow and temperature of river systems, affecting the lifecycle of mussels and their host fish. It can also lead to habitat fragmentation and isolation of populations.

4. **Increased Frequency of Severe Droughts:** Drought conditions can significantly reduce water levels, affecting the habitat availability for Pleurobema athearni and its ability to sustain its life cycle. Reduced water flows can also concentrate pollutants, further degrading water quality.

5. **Lack of Successful Reproduction and Recruitment:** Evidence shows that there is a lack of small size classes observed in the population, indicating issues with juvenile survival or the inability of adults to produce viable offspring in sufficient numbers to sustain the population. This could be due to a combination of the above threats impacting the survival of both adult and juvenile stages of the mussel.

6. **Habitat Degradation:** Implicit in several of the threats mentioned is the overarching issue of habitat degradation, which encompasses the physical, chemical, and biological alterations of the river/stream environments necessary for the mussels' survival, including changes to the river substrate, water chemistry, and flow regimes.

These threats collectively contribute to the status of the Canoe Creek Clubshell as endangered, with a high degree of threat and low recovery potential, emphasizing the need for recovery efforts that address water quality, sedimentation, and habitat preservation/enhancement."
40,Hylaeus assimulans,"Based on the extensive detail provided in the text, the identified threats to Hylaeus assimulans, also known as the assimulans yellow-faced bee, can be grouped into several categories:

1. **Loss and Degradation of Habitat**: This predominantly arises from anthropogenic factors such as development and agricultural expansion, which has significantly reduced coastal and lowland dry forest habitats where this bee species was historically found. The invasive species, particularly plants like kiawe trees that dominate the canopy in some areas, further degrade habitat quality.

2. **Climate Change and Related Environmental Threats**: Including drought and changes in precipitation patterns, which can affect the availability and quality of the bee's native plant food sources and nesting habitats. Given the bee's dependence on specific native plant species for nesting and food, alterations in plant phenology and distribution can have direct negative effects on the bee's populations.

3. **Isolation of Populations**: The fragmentation of habitats leads to isolated bee populations, which are then more vulnerable to extinction due to stochastic events, lower genetic diversity, and reduced capabilities for recolonization or expansion into suitable habitats.

4. **Limited Availability of Nesting Sites**: Given its ground-nesting behavior and reliance on natural cavities or burrows made by other insects, alterations to the soil structure and availability of suitable nesting sites through development, invasive species encroachment, or environmental degradation pose significant threats.

5. **Reduced Plant Diversity**: The bee's food sources are primarily native plant species, many of which are themselves threatened by habitat loss, invasive species, and climate change. The reduction in plant diversity and abundance directly impacts the bee's ability to find food and nest provisioning resources.

6. **Potential Inbreeding and Reduced Genetic Diversity**: With the small and fragmented bee populations, there's an increased risk of inbreeding, which can reduce genetic diversity and the species' adaptability to environmental changes and new threats.

7. **Insufficient Conservation Measures**: While some sites are recognized as natural reserves or are under some level of protection, the overall lack of specific, targeted conservation efforts directed at preserving and restoring the Hylaeus assimulans populations and their habitats is a latent threat.

8. **Anthropogenic Pressure**: The overarching presence of human development, including urban expansion, agricultural practices, and potentially pesticide use, although not directly cited, typically poses threats to native pollinators by altering their habitats, introducing pollutants, and facilitating the spread of invasive species.

To address these threats, a comprehensive conservation strategy involving habitat preservation and restoration, protection of native plant species, population monitoring, research on the bee's ecology and genetics, and possibly the development of captive breeding or relocation programs to enhance genetic diversity and resilience could be considered."
41,Ptychobranchus greenii,"As of my last update in September 2023, without any specific prior text directly provided about Ptychobranchus greenii (also known as the Paint Rock River fanshell), I can offer general insight into the types of threats faced by freshwater mussels like Ptychobranchus greenii, which might include:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Alteration:** Freshwater mussels are particularly vulnerable to changes in their habitat. This can include the destruction or modification of riverbeds through dredging, dam construction, or other infrastructure development. Alterations in the water flow can significantly impact their ability to feed, reproduce, and survive.

2. **Pollution:** Water pollution from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and urban stormwater can carry pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and other harmful chemicals into the rivers and streams where Ptychobranchus greenii lives. These contaminants can be detrimental to their health and the overall ecosystem.

3. **Climate Change:** Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect river flows and water quality. Extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, can further stress already vulnerable populations.

4. **Invasive Species:** Non-native species can outcompete indigenous mussels for food and habitat. For example, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have been known to attach to the shells of native mussels, inhibiting their ability to move, feed, and breathe, ultimately leading to their death.

5. **Overharvesting:** While this might not be as significant a threat for Ptychobranchus greenii specifically, overharvesting has historically been a problem for many mussel species, either for their shells or as a food source.

6. **Low Reproductive Rates and High Sensitivity to Environmental Changes:** Freshwater mussels, including Ptychobranchus greenii, often have complex life cycles and specific reproductive requirements. Many species are sensitive to changes in water temperature, quality, and flow for successful reproduction. Their larvae (glochidia) typically need to attach to a specific host fish to complete their development. Disruption in the presence of these fish species or in the ability of the larvae to attach can significantly impede reproduction.

Efforts to conserve Ptychobranchus greenii and similar species often focus on addressing these threats through habitat restoration, pollution control measures, regulations on water usage, and conservation programs aimed at bolstering populations and preserving genetic diversity."
42,Fusconaia cor,"The identified threats for Fusconaia cor, also known as shin y pigtoe, include a suite of stressors such as:

1. **Coal mining**
2. **Urbanization**
3. **Agriculture**
4. **Toxic chemical spills**

These threats can compromise the continued existence of the species throughout its range. Efforts are being made by the USFWS in collaboration with researchers and natural resource managers from various institutions and organizations to reduce pollutants in streams and improve the status of the species. This involves projects aimed at repairing and restoring streambanks, riparian areas, instream habitats, as well as reducing contaminants from upland activities. However, some limited progress has been made regarding protection from present and foreseeable anthropogenic and natural threats, indicating these efforts are ongoing and not fully mitigating the risks yet.

Additional concerns specifically affecting Fusconaia cor populations include:

- **Habitat degradation** related to the aforementioned threats, particularly impacting water quality and substrate conditions critical for the mussel's survival and recruitment.
- **Limited viability of populations** in certain rivers due to declines in abundance, recruitment issues, and catastrophic die-offs of unknown causes in some areas, which diminish the species' genetic diversity and adaptive potential.
- **Challenges in conservation and recovery efforts**, such as the need for development of propagation technology to enable species augmentation and reintroduction into historical habitats, and addressing primarily habitat-related issues before recovery can progress effectively.

Overall, while there are concerted efforts to address these threats and restore Fusconaia cor populations, significant challenges remain due to the multiplicity and magnitude of threats coupled with the species' specialized habitat requirements and current population status."
43,Pyrgulopsis sathos,"The identified threats for Pyrgulopsis sathos, or the White River Valley pyrg, based on the text include:

1. **Historical Impacts:** Historically, White River Valley pyrg's habitats have been influenced by a variety of human activities and environmental changes, including:
   - Surface water diversion
   - Impoundments
   - Channel modifications
   - Vegetation and soil disturbance from recreation and grazing by ungulates (hoofed animals, likely including domestic cattle and possibly wild species such as deer or elk)
   - Groundwater pumping

   Many of these conditions have since stabilized, but they have historically affected the stability and health of the populations of White River Valley pyrg.

2. **Future Threats:**
   - The text points out uncertainty regarding future groundwater pumping increases, the construction of the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) groundwater project, new water right applications, oil and gas applications, and how many groundwater wells will be drilled. Each of these uncertainties represents a potential threat to the White River Valley pyrg, mainly through the possible reduction in spring discharge and habitat quality.
   - Climate change is expected to lead to increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation within the range of White River Valley pyrg over the next 50 years, posing additional stress on their populations by potentially altering the springs and habitats they depend on.

3. **Resiliency and Adaptation Capacity:**
   - The resiliency of the White River Valley pyrg may be affected by reduced discharge due to the threats mentioned, which could adversely affect the size of the population, extent of habitat, and the species' ability to persist after disturbances.
   - While under scenario 2, which assumes reduced spring flow and discharge, the text expects 4 populations of White River Valley pyrg to retain high to moderate resiliency into the future, indicating some capacity for adaptation and resistance to threats.
   - The species' possibly adequate redundancy and maintained representation would be crucial for its future persistence, suggesting that genetic diversity among and within populations may enable some adaptability to changing environmental conditions.

In summary, the primary identified threats to Pyrgulopsis sathos include historical habitat modifications and disruptions, future climate change impacts, and uncertainties related to groundwater extractions. Despite these threats, the text suggests that there is a potential for the species to maintain its population through its adaptive capacities and conservation efforts to preserve its habitat."
44,Euproserpinus euterpe,"I'm sorry, I cannot assist with the request."
45,Pleuronaia barnesiana,"The identified threats for *Pleurobema barnesiana*, also known as the Tennessee pigtoe, based on the mentioned document include:

1. **Habitat Degradation:** The species prefers riffles, runs, shoals, and high gradient streams with stable substrates dominated by coarse sand, gravel, and cobble.

47,Erinna newcombi,"The identified threats for Erinna newcombi (Newcomb's Snail) include:

1. **Altered Hydrology**: Changes in the water ecosystem affect habitat availability and quality. This includes:
   - Agricultural development and stream diversion causing loss of habitat.
   - Dewatering aquifers, resulting in habitat loss.
   - The construction of vertical wells and hydroelectric power developments leading to loss or degradation of habitat.
   - Channelization, which leads to habitat loss or degradation.

2. **Landslides and Flooding**: These natural events can cause loss or degradation of habitat, affecting the snailâ€™s environment negatively.

3. **Stochastic Events**: Events like hurricanes have the potential to cause direct mortality and reduced viability for snail populations due to environmental upheaval.

These threats all contribute to habitat degradation and loss, which are critical issues for the survival of Newcombâ€™s Snail. There is a mention of the lack of consistent monitoring and survey efforts in recent years, which further complicates understanding the full impact of these threats on the snail population. The threat of predation from non-native species, including the predatory snail Euglandina rosea, and other invertebrates, as well as the challenges posed by invasive species competition, climate change, and inadequate regulatory mechanisms for habitat protection, are ongoing concerns with no current conservation or management efforts listed in the summary review for addressing these threats directly."
48,Pseudocopaeodes eunus obscurus,"Based on the extensive information provided, the identified threats to Pseudocopaeodes eunus obscurus (Carson wandering skipper) are not explicitly listed in the excerpt provided. However, given the context of efforts reviewed in terms of recovery planning, land ownership, and occupancy surveys in various counties in Nevada and California, we can infer potential threats affecting this species:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Alteration**: The detailed descriptions of each site's status, land ownership changes, and urban or commercial development highlight habitat destruction and alteration as significant threats. Development projects, urban sprawl, and changes in land use can lead to the loss or fragmentation of habitats essential for the Carson wandering skipper.

2. **Changes in Land Management Practices**: Differences in land management activities, especially between public and formerly private lands, indicate that changes in these practices could threaten the butterfly's habitat. This can include alterations in grazing practices, land development, and changes in water management that affect the availability of nectar sources and larval host plants.

3. **Environmental Changes and Climate-related Impacts**: The note on Honey Lake being ephemeral, drying up in years of low precipitation, and the association of occupied areas with geothermal activity suggest that environmental changes and climate variability could pose threats. Changes in precipitation patterns, droughts, or other climate-related impacts could affect the wetlands, alkali flats, and springs that support the habitats of Pseudocopaeodes eunus obscurus.

4. **Potential Isolation of Populations**: The reports of survey efforts to locate other populations and the difficulty in finding populations outside of known areas hint at the potential threat of population isolation. This isolation can make populations more vulnerable to extinction due to reduced genetic diversity, decreased resilience to environmental changes, and restricted movement between habitats.

5. **Competition and Predation**: Although not explicitly mentioned, competition for resources (such as nectar plants) and predation by natural or introduced species could be potential threats, as these factors often impact small, localized populations of specialized species.

6. **Human-induced Factors**: Factors such as pollution, pesticide use, recreational activities, and vehicular traffic might also be inferred as threats since the butterfly's habitat overlaps with areas that are or have become urbanized or are being developed for commercial use.

Efforts for conservation, such as land acquisition by BLM and the identification of new nectar sites, indicate ongoing work to mitigate these threats. However, without explicit details on the identified threats from the text, these inferences highlight common issues faced by endangered species with restricted ranges and specialized habitat requirements."
49,Elaphrus viridis,"The identified threats for the Delta Green Ground Beetle (Elaphrus viridis) as discussed in the review include:

1. **Habitat Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment (Factor A)**: The primary threat to the beetle is the destruction, modification, or curtailing of its habitat, especially due to human activities that lead to the loss or degradation of vernal pool habitats. This includes development, agricultural conversion, and other changes to the landscape that eliminate or significantly alter the beetle's natural environment.

2. **Invasive Plants (Factor A)**: Degradation of habitat by invasive plants is another significant threat. Invasive species can alter the ecological characteristics of vernal pool habitats, making them unsuitable for the beetle. Management plans addressing invasive species control are important for conserving beetle populations.

3. **Lack of Protection for Critical Habitat (Factor A)**: While some habitat for the beetle is being acquired for conservation purposes, nearly half of the beetleâ€™s known occurrences are on unprotected private lands. The lack of comprehensive protection for critical habitats exposes these areas to potential threats that could further endanger the beetle.

4. **Potential Threats Not Included in Initial Listing (Factors B and E)**: While not initially included in the listing rule, the recovery plan addresses overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes (Factor B), and other man-made or natural factors affecting its continued existence (Factor E) due to information gained subsequent to the listing of the species. Though not extensively detailed, these factors could include issues like climate change or pollution.

5. **Inadequate Knowledge for Conservation (Research Needs)**: The review highlights a significant gap in knowledge regarding the beetle's life cycle, habitat preferences, and ecological needs. The need for further research into many aspects of its biology and ecology is crucial for effective conservation strategies. Without this knowledge, efforts to protect and manage habitats may be less effective.

6. **Lack of Implemented Recovery Actions**: Although the recovery plan outlines crucial steps like habitat protection, adaptive management, monitoring, research, and outreach, the review indicates that many of these steps are only partially met or not met at all. For instance, reintroduction efforts have not been conducted, and management plans, while developed, are not fully implemented across all necessary areas.

These threats and challenges highlight the importance of targeted conservation actions, including securing habitat protection, invasive species management, research to fill knowledge gaps, and effectively implementing the recovery plan's recommendations to ensure the survival and recovery of the Delta Green Ground Beetle."
50,Lemiox rimosus,"Based on the text provided, the identified threats for *Lemiox rimosus* (referred to in the document as Conradilla caelata, and by its common name, the Birdwing Pearly Mussel) include:

1. **Adverse Effects from Coal Industry-Related Pollution**: The population of Birdwing Pearly Mussel, especially in the Powell River and Clinch River, continues to be adversely affected by coal fines, which is a form of pollution resulting from coal mining activities. This type of pollution negatively impacts the mussel population by degrading water quality and habitat substrate, making it inhospitable for the mussels.

2. **Development and Construction Activities**: Both the Birdwing Pearly Mussel and other species mentioned in the document are subject to adverse effects from various construction and development activities. These activities can lead to habitat destruction, increased sedimentation, changes in water chemistry, reductions in dissolved oxygen, and destabilization of the substrate, all of which can harm mussel populations.

3. **Agricultural and Highway Construction**: Specific to the Cracking Pearly Mussel but relevant to the Birdwing Pearly Mussel due to similar ecological requirements, these activities contribute to habitat degradation and increased pollution. Even though mostly discussed for the Cracking Pearly Mussel, similar threats apply to the Birdwing Pearly Mussel due to shared river habitats.

4. **Reservoir Operations and Non-point Source Pollution**: The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reservoir operations, along with non-point source pollution, are noted as contributing to the decline of populations in the Elk River and the mainstem of the Tennessee River. These operations and generalized pollution sources can alter water flows, temperatures, and quality, all of which can negatively affect mussel habitats and populations.

5. **Failed Achievement in Recovery Tasks**: While not a direct threat, the failure to meet criteria and tasks for recovery, including protection under existing laws and regulations, indicates ongoing threats and lack of effective mitigation against existing threats. Failure to fully characterize habitat needs, protect existing populations, and improve habitat quality underscores the ongoing risks and lack of progress toward stabilizing or improving populations. 

6. **Habitat Degradation from Metals and Other Contaminants**: Studies have indicated that metals such as copper, lead, and mercury, which can be present in water bodies due to human activities, accumulate in the mussels and are toxic. Ammonia is also mentioned as being particularly toxic to mussels at low concentrations. These contaminants likely originate from industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and other anthropogenic sources.

These threats highlight the complex interplay of anthropogenic impacts, including pollution, habitat destruction, and regulatory challenges, in the decline of the Birdwing Pearly Mussel populations."
51,Lampsilis streckeri,"As of my last update in September 2021, without the provided text explicitly containing the information, I can offer insights into the general threats that species like Lampsilis streckeri, a type of freshwater mussel, commonly face. However, specific threats to Lampsilis streckeri, also known as Strecker's Pocketbook mussel, would need to be referenced directly from up-to-date conservation status reports or scientific research. Generally, freshwater mussels including species within the genus Lampsilis are threatened by:

1. **Habitat Loss and Degradation**: Changes to their natural habitats due to dam construction, dredging, and the alteration of water flow can significantly impact their populations. Sedimentation from construction and agriculture can bury mussels and their food sources.

2. **Pollution**: Runoff containing pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants from agricultural fields, urban areas, and industrial sites can poison freshwater mussels and reduce water quality, affecting their survival.

3. **Climate Change**: Alterations in water temperature, pH, and flow patterns due to climate change can impact the life cycles and distribution of freshwater mussels.

4. **Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can outcompete native mussels for food and space. For example, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have decimated native mussel populations in many waterways by attaching to their shells and hindering their ability to function.

5. **Overharvesting**: Although this is less of a threat for Lampsilis streckeri specifically, some mussel species have been overharvested in the past for their shells, which were used in the button industry and for pearl cultivation.

6. **Reduced Host Fish Populations**: Many Lampsilis mussels have complex life cycles that involve parasitizing specific fish species during their larval stage. Declines in these host fish populations can limit the mussels' ability to reproduce successfully.

Addressing the threats to Lampsilis streckeri and other freshwater mussels requires concerted conservation efforts, including habitat restoration, pollution reduction, legal protection, and research on their life history and ecology."
52,Cicurina madla,"The identified threats for Cicurina madla, or the Madla Cave Meshweaver, are primarily habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation resulting from urban development. The spider's survival is closely tied to the preservation of adequate and intact networks of subterranean habitats that provide living space and a buffer from humidity and temperature extremes. These habitats must maintain high humidity and stable temperatures, as troglobitic species like Cicurina madla exhibit adaptations to subterranean environments and rely on specific in-cave conditions.

Key threats include:

1. **Habitat Destruction**: Urban development can lead to the physical destruction of the karst landscapes and subterranean voids where these spiders live. This can directly eliminate populations of the species or cut them off from necessary resources.

2. **Habitat Degradation**: Changes to the karst environment, such as alterations in water flow or quality due to construction and development, can degrade habitats, making them unsuitable for Cicurina madla.

3. **Habitat Fragmentation**: Urbanization can fragment habitats, isolating populations of Cicurina madla. This can reduce genetic flow between populations, decrease genetic diversity, and increase vulnerability to other threats.

4. **Changes in Humidity and Temperature**: As the troglobitic species depend on high humidity and stable temperatures, any changes to these conditions due to external factors could threaten their survival. Changes may occur due to alterations in surface vegetation cover, changes in water flow, or other disturbances associated with development activities.

5. **Introduction of Contaminants**: Urban development can lead to the pollution of groundwater and subsurface voids through runoff and spills, affecting the quality of the habitat.

6. **Competition and Predation by Invasive Species**: The introduction of invasive species, such as the red-imported fire ant (RIFA), can also threaten Cicurina madla through increased predation or competition for resources.

Conservation efforts focusing on preserving and managing the integrity of karst ecosystems, including ensuring functional surface and subsurface drainage basins and maintaining nutrient input from surface habitats, are crucial for the survival of Cicurina madla. Protecting large, connected karst areas from urban development and other disturbances is essential for ensuring a stable environment that supports the complex subterranean ecosystems where these spiders thrive."
53,Amblema neislerii,"The identified threats for *Amblema neislerii* (fat threeridge) are outlined below based on the recovery plan from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service:

1. **Significant Habitat Loss**: One of the primary threats to the survival of *Amblema neislerii* includes the significant loss of its natural habitat. Habitat alteration and degradation due to various anthropogenic activities have led to a drastic reduction in suitable living conditions for this species.

2. **Range Restriction**: The species has witnessed a considerable restriction in its range. Due to various factors, including habitat degradation and isolation, *Amblema neislerii* has been extirpated from significant portions of its historical range, especially in the main stems of certain rivers where it was once found.

3. **Population Fragmentation**: The populations of *Amblema neislerii* have become fragmented. Fragmentation due to physical barriers such as dams, and environmental changes, have led to isolated populations that are more vulnerable to extinction.

4. **Reduction in Population Size**: Alongside habitat loss and fragmentation, there has been a notable reduction in the population size of *Amblema neislerii*. The diminished population size further exacerbates the species' vulnerability to extinction.

5. **Vulnerability to Catastrophic Events**: The restricted distribution and reduced population sizes make localized subpopulations of *Amblema neislerii* highly susceptible to adverse habitat and water quality alterations, toxic chemical spills, and other catastrophic events which could have dire consequences for their survival.

6. **Adverse Effects of Genetic Isolation**: The genetic isolation resulting from population fragmentation is another significant threat. This isolation can lead to reduced genetic diversity, making the species more susceptible to diseases and reducing their ability to adapt to environmental changes.

7. **Little Evidence of Recent Recruitment**: The document indicates there is minimal evidence of recent recruitment (the addition of new individuals to the population) for *Amblema neislerii*. This lack of new individuals being added to the population makes it challenging for the species to recover from its current endangered status.

These identified threats underline the critical situation of *Amblema neislerii* and the urgent need for conservation actions to mitigate these threats and support the recovery and survival of the species."
54,Helminthoglypta walkeriana,"Based on the text, the identified threats for Helminthoglypta walkeriana (Morro shoulderband snail) include:

1. **Habitat destruction and degradation due to development:** This pointedly refers to urban, industrial, or agricultural development that alters or destroys the natural habitats where the snail resides.

2. **Invasion by non-native plants such as veldt grass:** Non-native or invasive plant species can alter the habitat in ways that make it unsuitable for native species like the Morro shoulderband snail. Invasive plants can outcompete native vegetation, change soil composition, or alter hydrology in ways that negatively impact native species.

3. **Structural changes in the vegetation due to plant senescence:** As plant communities age and go through natural cycles of growth and decay, the resulting changes in the structure of the vegetation can impact the habitat's suitability for the snail. For example, changes in canopy cover or the density of the underbrush can affect humidity levels and temperature, which are critical for the snail's survival.

4. **Recreational use (e.g., off-highway vehicle activity):** Activities such as off-roading and other forms of outdoor recreation can lead to direct harm to the snails through crushing, as well as indirect harm through habitat destruction, compaction of soil, and pollution.

5. **Competition with the brown garden snail (Helix aspersa):** The introduction and spread of non-native snail species can lead to competition for food and habitat, possibly outcompeting the native Morro shoulderband snail.

6. **Molluscicides:** The use of chemicals to control or eliminate snails and slugs in gardens and agricultural areas can inadvertently harm non-target species like the Morro shoulderband snail.

7. **Prospect of extirpation of those populations that are small and isolated:** Small and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction due to a lack of genetic diversity, increased susceptibility to stochastic events, and reduced capacity for recolonization.

These threats demonstrate the wide range of human-induced and ecological challenges that Helminthoglypta walkeriana faces, underscoring the importance of targeted conservation efforts to mitigate these threats and support the species' recovery."
55,Theliderma intermedia,"The identified threats to Theliderma intermedia (formerly recognized as Quadrula intermedia) based on the extensive documentation provided include:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Modification:** Activities leading to the alteration of natural water flow and quality, such as impoundment, alterations for navigation, and other developments impact Theliderma intermedia's habitat. Examples include cold-water releases from dams affecting river temperature regimes and hydro-peaking flows causing bank and channel instability. Increased water withdrawals by municipalities also threaten this species in rivers like the Duck River.

2. **Siltation and Pollution:** Siltation from agricultural runoff, construction, and especially coal mining activities significantly threaten the species, particularly in the Powell River. Increased sedimentation and pollutants from these sources directly impact the mussel's habitat quality by burying the riverbed substrates necessary for the mussel's survival and reproduction.

3. **Coal Mining:** The expansion of coal mining, particularly in the Powell River drainage, increases habitat degradation through siltation and the release of pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals. A new coal-fired power plant under construction is expected to exacerbate these impacts due to increased coal demand and mining.

4. **Inadequate Regulatory Mechanisms:** Existing regulations may not adequately protect Theliderma intermedia from various anthropogenic threats. Although it is listed as endangered and thereby has some measures of protection against direct exploitation, there is a lack of comprehensive habitat protection from development, mining, and pollution under current laws and regulations.

5. **Proposed Dam Projects and Water Management Practices:** Past and potentially future dam projects can significantly alter the habitat conditions necessary for Theliderma intermedia. Improved management practices by TVA have been noted to benefit the species, yet the overall threat from altered water flow and quality remains, particularly from projects that were proposed but not completed, and ongoing practices that affect water temperature and flow.

6. **Lack of Population Resilience and Recruitment:** Despite some improvements, overall recruitment appears to be low, especially in the Powell River, indicating ongoing challenges for the species' recovery. The document highlighted a need for better understanding and improvement in reproductive success, recruitment, and population viability.

7. **Lack of Comprehensive Habitat Protection Measures:** While some efforts are being made to improve stream and riparian habitats, the threat from ongoing and potentially increasing activities that degrade these habitats remains a concern. There's an emphasis on needing more concerted and effective conservation measures to protect and restore habitats.

These threats highlight the complex range of factors affecting Theliderma intermedia, requiring comprehensive, multi-faceted conservation strategies involving habitat protection, pollution control, and targeted recovery efforts to address both immediate threats and long-term species viability."
56,Polyphylla barbata,"The identified threats for Polyphylla barbata, the Mount Hermon June beetle, based on the extensive review outlined include:

1. **Habitat destruction and loss** primarily due to sand mining and urban development. Although sand mining has been drastically reduced, the residual effects of past mining have led to habitat fragmentation and degradation, making these areas unsuitable for the species.

2. **Recreational use of habitat** removes established plant cover, causes erosion, precludes plant recolonization, and can restrict use of habitat by the insects within the sandhills area.

3. **Altered fire regimes** and chaparral succession, identified as the predominant threat, are linked to suppression of natural fire cycles. Fire suppression and/or exclusion in a fire-adapted ecosystem often release pioneering native and non-native species from natural controls, allowing for rapid colonization, promoting the dominance of later-successional shrubs and trees, and reducing the amount of open canopy. This, in turn, affects the availability of the exposed sandy soil required for MHJB burrowing.

4. **Climate Change** is predicted to increase temperatures and the likelihood of extreme storms, drought, and wildfire, which could have an overall negative effect on both the MHJB and their habitat. These changes may disrupt life history traits that are influenced by temperature and precipitation.

5. **Agricultural conversion** of sandhills habitat to vineyards and other agricultural uses continues to be a concern, albeit on a smaller scale compared to past threats.

6. **Predation and disease** have not been highlighted as direct threats in the summary, but there is mention of MHJB potentially being preyed upon by bats, which feed during the MHJB active period, indicating an existing, albeit maybe not predominant, threat of predation.

7. **The effects of pesticides and overcollection** were initially considered as threats at the time of listing. Though they were later assessed as unlikely to be significant threats, the status review document doesn't provide exhaustive current information to completely discount these as potential concerns.

The status review indicates that while some progress has been made in terms of habitat restoration and conservation, significant threats remain that prevent the recovery of Polyphylla barbata. Effective management strategies, including further research on reintroduction possibilities, land conservation efforts, and maintaining a stable or increasing population size, are recommended to ensure the species' survival."

14. The limited number of known populations, small range, and restricted habitat which further increases the subspecies' susceptibility to extinction or extirpation from significant parts of its range due to random events."
58,Elimia crenatella,"Based on the provided text, the identified threats to **Elimia crenatella** (Lacy Elimia) are not explicitly detailed in the selected sections. However, general information from the status review and recovery criteria sections can help infer potential threats. For lacy elimia and similar species under review, common threats likely impacting their status and hindering their recovery include:

1. **Water Quality Degradation:** Comments provided by environmental law centers emphasize threats to water quality in relevant drainage areas (e.g., Black Warrior River drainage). Poor water quality can stem from pollution, agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and urban development, impacting the habitat and survival of aquatic species like Elimia crenatella.

2. **Habitat Destruction:** The mention of recovery criteria not being met due to apparent or immediate threats to population, and issues related to establishing additional populations within the historical range, suggest habitat destruction or alteration as a significant concern. Habitat destruction could be due to construction, development projects, damming of rivers, mining, and other forms of economic activity that alter or destroy the natural riverine habitats these snails depend on.

3. **Lack of Standardized Monitoring:** The absence of standardized annual monitoring plans indicates a potential threat from insufficient data on population trends, distribution, and the effectiveness of conservation measures. Without regular and comprehensive monitoring, it's challenging to accurately assess the species' status and address threats effectively.

4. **Compromised Reproductive Success:** For species like Elimia crenatella, specific life history traits (e.g., unique reproductive methods) could be threatened by environmental changes, affecting their ability to reproduce and maintain stable populations. While the document does not specify this for lacy elimia, the general biology of closely related species suggests that changes in water flow, temperature, and quality can impact their reproductive success.

5. **Limited Distribution and Population Fragmentation:** The criteria for delisting include having a minimum number of stable or increasing populations for a set period. The failure to meet these criteria implies that limited distribution and fragmentation remain significant threats, likely due to the cumulative impact of habitat destruction, water quality issues, and other environmental stresses.

In conclusion, while specific threats to Elimia crenatella (Lacy Elimia) are not enumerated in the provided text excerpts, the overall context of endangered and threatened status reviews suggests that water quality degradation, habitat destruction, insufficient monitoring and data collection, compromised reproductive success, and limited distribution are likely key threats facing this species."
59,Pleurobema perovatum,"Based on the information you've shared, there's no specific content provided to identify the threats to Pleurobema perovatum directly. However, I can offer insight into the common threats to mussel species, including Pleurobema perovatum, which is a freshwater mussel species.

The threats to freshwater mussels such as Pleurobema perovatum generally include:

1. **Habitat Loss and Degradation**: This can be caused by dam construction, water pollution from agricultural runoff, industrial discharge, mining activities, and urbanization. Habitat degradation also includes changes in sediment and flow patterns that affect the riverbeds where these mussels live.

2. **Pollution**: Chemical pollution from pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants can severely affect mussels' survival by poisoning them or their food sources. Nutrient pollution can lead to algal blooms that deplete oxygen in the water, harming mussels.

3. **Climate Change**: Changes in water temperature and flow patterns can affect the reproduction and survival of freshwater mussels. Increased frequency and severity of droughts or floods can also have detrimental effects.

4. **Invasive Species**: Invasive species such as the zebra mussel outcompete native mussels for food and space. They can also physically smother native mussels by attaching to their shells in large numbers.

5. **Hydrologic Alterations**: Alterations to water flow due to damming, diversion, and water withdrawal can impact the habitat and the delicate balance mussels need for spawning and feeding.

6. **Disease and Parasitism**: Emerging diseases and parasites can threaten populations that are already stressed by other factors, leading to declines.

Conservation of Pleurobema perovatum and other freshwater mussels involves addressing these threats by protecting habitats, reducing pollution, managing invasive species, and enforcing legal protections. Given Pleurobema perovatum's specific condition, conservation efforts would need to be tailored to its unique situation and the ecosystems it inhabits."
60,Polyphylla barbata,"Based on the provided text, the identified threats to Polyphylla barbata, the Mount Hermon June beetle, include:

1. **Sand Mining**: Extraction of sand from the beetle's habitat disrupts the soil structure and vegetation cover, leading to habitat degradation or loss.

2. **Urban Development**: Expansion of urban areas encroaches on the beetle's natural habitat, resulting in fragmentation and potential loss of populations.

3. **Agricultural Conversion**: Changing natural habitats into agricultural lands further reduces the available habitat for Polyphylla barbata.

4. **Equestrian Use**: Activities related to horseback riding can lead to soil compaction and disruption of the beetle's habitat.

5. **Recreational Activities**: Various forms of outdoor recreational activities can lead to degradation of the habitat through soil compaction, littering, and disturbance.

6. **Alteration in Natural Fire Regimes**: Changes in the natural cycles of wildfire can impact the ecosystem balance, potentially harming species dependent on specific fire regimes for habitat maintenance or renewal.

7. **Competition with Nonnative Vegetation**: The spread of invasive plant species can alter habitat structure, outcompete native plants, and reduce the quality and availability of habitat for native species like Polyphylla barbata.

8. **Overcollection**: Collecting specimens for scientific study, as pets, or for sale could reduce the population sizes of the beetle.

9. **Pesticide Use**: The application of pesticides for agricultural or urban purposes can poison the beetles or reduce their food sources.

The combination of these threats contributes to the vulnerability of Polyphylla barbata, placing it at great risk of extinction due to the potential for these factors to dramatically reduce its population size and limit its ability to recover."
61,Potamilus capax,"Based on your prompt, it seems like there's an expectation to analyze specific threats to Potamilus capax (a species of freshwater mussel) from a text provided. However, as the original content meant to list these threats hasn't been supplied, I will outline potential generic threats faced by freshwater mussels like Potamilus capax based on current knowledge and conservation studies:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Alteration**: Freshwater mussels are highly sensitive to changes in their habitats. Construction projects, damming of rivers, dredging, and other alterations that change water flow, sediment deposition, or water chemistry can have devastating impacts.

2. **Pollution**: Pollution from agricultural runoff (containing pesticides and fertilizers), industrial effluents, and urban runoff can severely affect the water quality, making it inhospitable for these mussels. Chemical pollutants can impair the musselsâ€™ ability to feed, reproduce, and survive.

3. **Climate Change**: Changes in climatic patterns can lead to alterations in river flow regimes, temperature fluctuations, and increased frequency of extreme weather events, all of which can adversely affect mussel populations.

4. **Invasive Species**: Introduction of non-native species can compete with native mussels for food and habitat. Some invasive species can also directly harm mussels by preying on them or by altering the habitat in ways that are deleterious to native mussel populations.

5. **Overexploitation**: Although not as significant a threat today as in the past, overharvesting for pearls, shells, or as food can lead to population declines.

6. **Disease and Parasites**: Emerging diseases and parasites can affect mussels, sometimes exacerbated by stressors such as pollution or habitat loss, leading to mortality or reduced fitness.

7. **Hydrological Changes**: Alteration in the natural flow of rivers through water withdrawals, dam operation, or diversions can negatively impact the ecosystem, affecting the life cycles and reproductive success of mussels.

To better understand the specific threats to Potamilus capax, it is essential to consult targeted conservation research, including species recovery plans or conservation assessments that focus on this particular species. Without the original text, these general threats to freshwater mussels provide a basis for understanding the types of challenges Potamilus capax might face."

63,Pleurobema georgianum,"The identified threats for **Pleurobema georgianum** (Georgia Pigtoe), which could be inferred based on the threats to the aquatic ecosystem of the Mobile River Basin as presented in the recovery plan, include:

1. **Habitat Loss and Degradation**: Major threats to the basin's aquatic ecosystem include impoundment (creation of reservoirs or dams), channelization (altering a stream's course), mining, dredging, and pollution from both point (specific, identifiable sources) and nonpoint (diffuse, scattered sources) sources. These activities can lead to the direct loss of habitats or significant alterations that make them unsuitable for endemic species, including mussels like Pleurobema georgianum.

2. **Pollution**: The plan specifies pollution from point and nonpoint sources as critical threats to the aquatic biota of the Mobile River Basin. For mussels, water quality degradation through chemical pollutants, sedimentation, and thermal pollution can be particularly detrimental, affecting their survival, reproduction, and the availability of food (e.g., through impacts on phytoplankton and detritus).

3. **Impoundments and Altered Water Flows**: The creation of dams and reservoirs leads to altered water flows, which can change the sediment deposition patterns, water temperature, and other physical and chemical parameters of the water. Mussels like Pleurobema georgianum rely on specific flow conditions for their life processes, such as feeding, respiring, and reproducing.

4. **Hydrological Alterations Beyond Dams**: Activities like withdrawal for irrigation, urban use, and industrial use can alter the natural flow regimes of rivers and streams. This can lead to periods of unnaturally low flows, affecting the habitat suitability for mussels.

5. **Biological Factors**: While not directly mentioned in the provided text, it is generally known that invasive species, diseases, and the decline of host fish species (required for the larval stage of mussels) can also be significant threats to mussels like Pleurobema georgianum.

Recovering Pleurobema georgianum and other aquatic species in the Mobile River Basin will require addressing these threats through habitat protection and restoration, pollution control, maintaining natural flow regimes, and fostering community engagement and stewardship in watershed management."
64,Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis,"The identified threats for Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis, also known as the Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly, as per the 5-Year Review document include:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Modification:** Past and ongoing threats have included residential and commercial development leading to significant habitat destruction. Although the threat has been partly mitigated through conservation efforts, the available habitat for the Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly remains significantly limited.

2. **Non-native Weed Invasion:** The invasion of non-native weeds threatens the butterfly by altering its habitat and competing with native plant species vital for the butterflyâ€™s survival, including its larval host plants.

3. **Small Population Size and Isolation:** The Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly suffers from very small and isolated populations which are more susceptible to extinction due to factors such as inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and demographic stochasticity. These small, isolated populations are also at increased risk from stochastic events such as wildfires, floods, droughts, or disease outbreaks.

4. **Lack of a Comprehensive Recovery Plan:** While a recovery plan exists, it is outdated and lacks specific, measurable criteria for downlisting the species.

Conservation actions and regulatory mechanisms have been implemented to address some of these threats. These include habitat restoration efforts, a successful captive breeding program, and protections under federal and state laws. Most notably, the Department of Defenseâ€™s efforts at the Defense Fuel Support Point in San Pedro, which houses a significant population of the butterfly, and the development of a Natural Community Conservation Plan/Habitat Conservation Plan (NCCP/HCP) by the City of Rancho Palos Verdes aim to conserve large areas of habitat potential for recovery of this species.

Despite these efforts, the species remains vulnerable, and the document recommends continued listing as endangered with no change in status due to ongoing threats and the necessity of further conservation action to ensure long-term survival and recovery."
65,Pleuronaia dolabelloides,Document error...
66,Pyrgulopsis erythropoma,"Based on the provided text, the identified threats for **Pyrgulopsis erythropoma**, also known as the Ash Meadows pebblesnail, can be summarised as follows:

1. **Predation and Competition**: Pyrgulopsis erythropoma faces threats from non-native species that can either prey on it or outcompete it for resources. The presence of invasive species that can alter the ecosystem balance is a significant threat to its survival.

2. **Vegetation and Soil Disturbance**: Human activities and natural processes that lead to changes in aquatic vegetation and soil can directly affect the habitat of Pyrgulopsis erythropoma. These disturbances can alter water clarity, flow, and the physical make-up of the spring environment, which can impact the survival of the pebblesnail.

3. **Water Pollution**: Contamination of water sources from agricultural runoff, waste discharge, or other pollutants can severely degrade the habitat. Water quality is crucial for the survival of springsnails, and pollutants can directly or indirectly harm them, either through toxic substances or by altering the habitat conditions (e.g., nutrient levels leading to excessive algal growth).

4. **Spring Modifications**: Any alterations to the spring's natural flow or physical structure, through human development or other interventions, can have dramatic impacts. These modifications can change the temperature, flow rate, or even dry up the springs that Pyrgulopsis erythropoma depends on for survival.

5. **Inadequate Spring Discharge**: Reduction in spring water flow, whether from natural variations or human-induced changes like groundwater pumping, poses a threat to the springsnail. Adequate discharge is necessary to maintain the habitat's physical and biological needs, including suitable aquatic vegetation and substrate.

These threats, if not managed or mitigated, can lead to reduction in habitat suitability and spring discharge, directly affecting the viability of populations of Pyrgulopsis erythropoma by impacting their resilience, redundancy, and representation. Given its already limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, the species is particularly vulnerable to changes that negatively affect spring ecosystems."
67,Faxonius quadruncus,"The identified threats to Faxonius quadruncus, also known as the St. Francis River Crayfish, are:

1. **Invasion by the Woodland Crayfish (Faxonius hylas):** The Woodland Crayfish, which is native to southeastern Missouri in the Black River drainage and the headwaters of the Meramec and Big rivers, was discovered outside of its native range in Stout's Creek, a tributary of the St. Francis River, in 1984, presumably from a bait bucket introduction. Its presence in multiple reaches of the Upper St. Francis River watershed has been documented, with substantial reductions in abundance of the Big Creek and St. Francis River Crayfishes noted in invaded areas. In some areas, the native species have been completely displaced by the Woodland Crayfish. The mechanism of displacement may involve reproductive interference in the form of hybridization.

2. **Heavy Metal Contamination:** The legacy of lead mining in southeastern Missouri has left contamination that affects fish and other aquatic biota. This contamination results in altered fish and invertebrate communities, as well as public health advisories against human consumption of lead-contaminated fish. Studies from other areas in Missouri indicate that heavy metals and mining-related tailings adversely affect riffle-dwelling crayfishes. Sites downstream of mining activities show significant issues including higher metal concentrations in crayfish, lower crayfish densities, and reduced crayfish survival.

3. **Sedimentation:** The Upper St. Francis River watershed features little gravel accumulation due to its surrounding geology. However, localized areas have excessive sedimentation due to eroding or breached mine tailings. This sedimentation can cover rocks and cavities used by the Big Creek and St. Francis River Crayfishes as refugia. The presence of crayfish is dependent on open interstitial spaces and rocks embedded in little or no sediment. Thus, sedimentation can reduce carrying capacity and subpopulation densities of these crayfishes, increase predation risk, and exacerbate competition with the invasive Woodland Crayfish."
68,Pleurobema perovatum,"Based on the provided text, which seems to be missing, I cannot explicitly identify the threats to Pleurobema perovatum because the relevant information was not included. However, I can infer the common threats facing Pleurobema perovatum, a species of mussel, based on general threats to freshwater mussels:

1. **Habitat Destruction**: This includes the alteration of river and stream beds through damming, dredging, and channelization. Habitat destruction can eliminate or degrade the environments necessary for their survival.

2. **Pollution**: Freshwater mussels are sensitive to water quality and can be significantly impacted by pollution from agricultural run-off, industrial discharges, and urban stormwater, which introduce toxins, sediment, and nutrients that can negatively affect these organisms.

3. **Climate Change**: Changes in global weather patterns can alter the aquatic ecosystems where Pleurobema perovatum lives. This can result in altered water temperatures, reduced water levels during droughts, and increased flooding, all of which can harm mussel populations.

4. **Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can have negative effects on native mussels, including competition for food and space, predation, and habitat alteration.

5. **Water Withdrawal**: Extraction of water for agricultural, industrial, and domestic use can lead to habitat degradation by reducing the quantity of the water available for mussels.

6. **Disease and Parasites**: Emerging diseases and parasites can pose significant threats to mussel populations, contributing to declines and possibly local extinctions.

For a specific assessment of threats to Pleurobema perovatum, consulting recent scientific studies or conservation reports would be required since the impact of these threats can vary significantly depending on the region and the specific environmental conditions of the habitat in which the mussels are found."
69,Elliptio lanceolata,"The identified threats to **Elliptio lanceolata** (Yellow Lance) include:

1. **Habitat Degradation**: This is caused by various forms of land use change and associated watershed-level effects which have an impact on water quality, water quantity, habitat connectivity, and in-stream habitat quality. The cumulative impacts of land use change appear to be a significant threat to the habitat of the Yellow Lance.

2. **Pollution**: The presence of pollutants in the water affects the water quality, which in turn, impacts the survival and distribution of the Yellow Lance populations. Pollution can come from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and urban runoff.

3. **Reduced Stream Flow**: Changes in water quantity, whether due to withdrawal for human use, changes in land use (which can alter how water infiltrates into groundwater versus runs off into streams), or climate change, can reduce stream flows. Reduced flows can impact the in-stream habitats that Yellow Lance needs, making them unsuitable for the species to survive.

4. **Habitat Fragmentation**: The fragmentation of habitats, due to human infrastructure such as dams, roads, and developments, disrupts the connectivity between populations of Yellow Lance. This can prevent gene flow between populations, reduce the area available for the species' occupancy, and impact the long-term viability of the species.

5. **Climate Change**: The effects of climate change, like increasing temperatures and more frequent and severe droughts, can further degrade habitats. Climate change exacerbates other threats such as habitat degradation and changes in stream flow.

6. **Isolation of Populations**: As populations become smaller and more fragmented, their ability to recover from disturbances and maintain genetic diversity decreases. This isolation makes populations more vulnerable to extirpation.

The SSA Report scenarios predict varying degrees of decline in the Yellow Lance's resilience, redundancy, and representation under different future conditions, mainly due to these threats. Addressing these threats is critical for the conservation and recovery of Yellow Lance populations."
70,Texella cokendolpheri,"8460 
Federal Register
/ Vol. 77, No. 30 / Tuesday, February 14, 2012 / Rules and Regulations

The provided text does not specifically outline threats to Texella cokendolpheri, but rather focuses on the designation of critical habitat for nine Bexar County, TX, invertebrates, including Texella cokendolpheri, under the Endangered Species Act. The detailed description and discussion mainly address the establishment of critical habitat areas, the rationale behind their selection, considerations for economic impacts, land value assessments, comments from State agencies, public comments, and responses to those comments.

However, through the general discussions on critical habitat designation, the underlying theme suggests that the identified threats to Texella cokendolpheri (Cokendolpher Cave harvestman) and the other eight invertebrates indirectly include:

1. **Habitat Destruction:** The loss, alteration, or degradation of habitat to support development, infrastructure improvement, or agricultural expansion can directly impact these species' survival.
   
2. **Human Activity:** Including construction, pollution, and the reduction of habitat quality through activities that might lead to a decrease in species population or genetic diversity due to reduced gene flow between isolated habitats.

3. **Invasive Species:** The mention of fire ants in the critical habitat discussion implies the threat of invasive species, which can outcompete or directly harm native species. 

4. **Climate Change:** A peer reviewer comment emphasizes the threat of climate change and the predicted increase in drying conditions in Texas, which could further endanger these species by altering their already fragile habitat.

5. **Geological and Hydrologic Features Modifications:** Alterations of landscape features central to the karst terrain may hinder the physical or biological features necessary for these invertebrates' survival, such as cave systems and mesocaverns offering shelter and foraging opportunities.

6. **Limited Genetic Diversity and Small Population Sizes:** Some reviewers noted concern for species known from a limited number of specimens and locations, suggesting vulnerability due to low genetic diversity and small population sizes making them more susceptible to environmental changes and stochastic events.

Overall, while not directly stated, these inferred threats align with the overall goals to protect and manage critical habitats as a measure to address and mitigate broader environmental and human-induced pressures on Texella cokendolpheri and the other eight invertebrate species in Bexar County, Texas."
71,Gammarus desperatus,"Based on the information provided in the recovery plan executive summary and other sections, the identified threats for *Gammarus desperatus* can be summarized as follows:

1. **Diminished Water Quantity:** The primary threat includes reduced water availability due to groundwater pumping and drought events. This results in lower aquifer levels, which in turn decreases the outflow from springs and seeps, vital for the species' survival.

2. **Water Quality Contamination:** Another significant threat is the contamination of water, which affects the clean, flowing water habitats that *Gammarus desperatus* relies on. Contaminants can come from various sources, including agricultural runoff, waste discharge, and other anthropogenic activities.

3. **Inadequate Regulatory Mechanisms:** Secondary threats include the insufficiency of existing laws and regulations to sufficiently protect *Gammarus desperatus* and its habitat from overuse or degradation.

4. **Localized Range and Limited Mobility:** The species' limited distribution and reduced ability to move across landscapes increase its vulnerability to localized threats, including habitat destruction or modification.

5. **Fragmented Habitat:** Habitat fragmentation poses a risk to *Gammarus desperatus* by isolating populations and reducing genetic diversity, which may impair the species' ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

6. **Climate Change:** The effects of climate change, including altered precipitation patterns and increased temperatures, can exacerbate existing threats, such as reducing water availability and quality.

7. **Invasive Species, Disease, and Predation:** Tertiary threats may include competition from invasive species, exposure to diseases, and predation, which could impact the survival and reproduction of *Gammarus desperatus*.

The recovery strategy focuses on mitigating these threats by preserving, restoring, and managing aquatic habitats and water resources essential for the species and the ecosystems that support it. Actions outlined include ensuring adequate water quantity and quality, protecting and restoring habitat, controlling invasive species, and engaging in community outreach to promote conservation."
72,Ambrysus amargosus,"I'm sorry, but I am unable to fulfill your request."
73,Hesperia leonardus montana,"The identified threats for Hesperia leonardus montana, outlined in the document, can be summarized as follows:

1. **Limited Habitat Range**: The species is confined to a very narrow geographic area, making it vulnerable to habitat loss and changes in habitat quality. The only known population occurs on the Pikes Peak Granite Formation within a limited square mileage area.

2. **Habitat Preference and Loss**: The Pawnee montane skipper prefers dry, open Ponderosa pine woodlands with a specific elevation and slope, coupled with specific undergrowth including blue grama grass (larval food plant) and prairie gayfeather (primary nectar plant). This specialized habitat requirement makes it susceptible to changes in land use, land management practices, and natural disturbances.

3. **Vegetation Management and Land Use**: Proper vegetation management on public lands is vital for maintaining the habitat of the skipper. Inadequate management, leading to either overgrowth that can alter the structure of the open woodlands or too much disturbance, can negatively affect the skipper's habitat.

4. **Habitat Fragmentation**: Fragmentation of their specialized habitat due to development, changes in land use, or other anthropogenic factors can isolate populations, making them more vulnerable to extinction.

5. **Conservation on Private Lands**: Part of the known habitat is owned by private individuals and the Denver Water Department, meaning conservation efforts need cooperation from these stakeholders to manage the land in ways that support the skipper's survival.

6. **Climate and Environmental Changes**: Given its narrow habitat range and specific requirements, environmental changes, including those brought about by climate change, could further stress the species.

7. **Potential for Overgrowth or Unsuitable Vegetative Changes**: The document suggests a need for open habitats with specific tree, grass, and flower densities. Overgrowth or changes in the vegetative composition that make the habitat unsuitable for the skipper or its nectar sources can be a threat.

The recovery strategy focuses on protecting existing habitats, preventing habitat fragmentation, ensuring a broad distribution of the species within its range, monitoring skipper and habitat quality, determining management criteria for habitat maintenance, and engaging private landowners in conservation agreements. The estimated cost for recovery and the target year for recovery efforts highlight the scope of action needed to address these threats effectively."
74,Lampsilis rafinesqueana,"It appears there is no specific text provided regarding Lampsilis rafinesqueana for me to reference directly in order to answer your question. However, I can give a general overview of the threats facing species like Lampsilis rafinesqueana, which is a type of freshwater mussel. Many freshwater mussels, including those in the Lampsilis genus, face several common threats, such as:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Degradation:** Construction of dams, water pollution from industrial, agricultural, and urban sources, and physical alterations of riverbeds and banks can destroy or severely impact mussel habitats. The alteration of natural water flow can also lead to significant changes in sediment deposition, which can smother mussels.

2. **Climate Change:** Changes in water temperature, flow patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events like droughts and floods can adversely affect freshwater mussels. Climate change can also exacerbate other issues, such as habitat loss.

3. **Invasive Species:** The introduction of non-native species can significantly impact native populations. For mussels, invasive species can outcompete them for food, alter their habitat, or introduce diseases and parasites.

4. **Overharvesting:** While not as much of a threat today in many places due to regulations, past overharvesting for the pearl button industry and for pearls and shells has led to significant declines in some freshwater mussel populations.

5. **Water Pollution:** Pollution from chemicals, heavy metals, pesticides, and other harmful substances can have lethal or sub-lethal effects on mussels. They are filter feeders and can accumulate toxins, which can lead to decreased reproduction rates and increased mortality.

6. **Reduced Host Fish Populations:** Many freshwater mussels, including those in the genus Lampsilis, have complex life cycles that involve using host fish for larval development. A decline in the host fish populations due to overfishing, habitat loss, or pollution can thus also negatively impact mussel populations.

For precise information on the threats facing Lampsilis rafinesqueana, consulting scientific literature or conservation status reports from organizations like the IUCN, Fish and Wildlife Service in the United States, or specific state/provincial natural resource departments would be ideal."
75,Triodopsis platysayoides,"The text you provided doesn't include any content to analyze for identified threats to Triodopsis platysayoides, which is a species of land snail. However, I can offer a general perspective on what commonly constitutes threats to land snails like Triodopsis platysayoides based on typical concerns for similar organisms.

For many snail species, threats often include:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Loss**: Changes in land use for agriculture, urban development, or logging can destroy or fragment the habitats land snails rely on for food, shelter, and reproduction.

2. **Pollution**: Pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants can contaminate the soils and plants snails depend on, leading to poisoning or reduced food sources.

3. **Climate Change**: Altered weather patterns can affect the humidity and temperature ranges that are critical for snails' survival. Extreme weather events can also directly damage snail populations or their habitats.

4. **Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native plants can alter the ecosystem balance, and invasive predators (including other snail species) can significantly reduce native snail populations.

5. **Disease**: Snails are susceptible to a variety of diseases and parasites, which can be exacerbated by human actions or other environmental stresses.

6. **Collection**: For some attractive or rare species, collecting for the pet trade or scientific purposes might pose a threat if not properly managed.

To understand the specific threats Triodopsis platysayoides faces, research into its particular habitat requirements, distribution, and the conservation status would be necessary, such as consulting scientific literature or databases focused on biodiversity and conservation."
76,Erinna newcombi,not exclude any areas from the final critical habitat designation based on approved habitat conservation plans or other conservation plans.
77,Pyrgulopsis neomexicana,"The identified threats for Pyrgulopsis neomexicana (Socorro Springsnail) as per the text include:

1. **Lack of Access to Torreon Spring:** The main threat is the inability to access Torreon Spring due to lack of cooperation with the private landowner. This prevents the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from monitoring and conserving the species (Factors A and D).

2. **Climate and Hydrologic Change:** Predictions by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of warmer temperatures and unpredictable precipitation patterns due to anthropogenic climate change threaten the species' habitat. This includes impacts on seasonal water temperature and availability at Torreon Spring, threatening the springsnail's only known habitat (Factors A and E).

3. **Introduction of Exotic Aquatic Species:** While currently considered unlikely due to the spring's location, the potential introduction of non-native species could pose increased threats through predation or competition if it were to occur (Factor C).

4. **Harvest/Collection Risk:** Despite currently being deemed unlikely due to restricted access to the property, there's a potential risk of harvest or collection by biologists and collectors, which could pose a threat to the extremely rare Socorro Springsnail (Factors B and E).

These threats are analyzed under the five factors required under section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act, correlating to: (A) habitat or range destruction/modification/curtailment, (B) over-utilization for various purposes, (C) disease or predation, (D) inadequate regulatory mechanisms, and (E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence."
78,Lampsilis rafinesqueana,"been documented.â„¢â„¢ The commenters suggest that the Service has not provided a sufficient basis for determining that the designated areas contain features essential to the conservation of the species.
Our Response:
The Service has based its designations of critical habitat on the best scientific data available, as required by the Act. While it is true that in many cases specific habitat requirements for the Neosho mucket and rabbitsfoot are not fully understood, the Service has identified physical and biological features essential for the conservation of these species based on current knowledge. These include, but are not limited to, stream flow, substrate type, water quality, and availability of fish hosts for larval mussels. The presence of stable, reproducing populations of the mussels signifies that these essential features are present in the designated critical habitat areas. Additionally, the Service has identified threats to these habitats that may require special management considerations or protection. The critical habitat designation process necessarily involves some level of professional judgment, especially for species with incomplete natural history information, and the Service makes every effort to use the best available science in making these determinations.

In specifying primary constituent elements (PCEs) or physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species, the Service has drawn upon a broad range of sources, including peer-reviewed literature, expert opinion, and practical experience with the species in their natural habitats. Although comprehensive data on every aspect of the species' habitat requirements may not be available, the Service has used the best available information to make informed decisions about what constitutes critical habitat for the Neosho mucket and rabbitsfoot. Further, as additional information becomes available, the Service can revise critical habitat designations through rulemaking.

Lastly, the Act requires that critical habitat be designated based on what is known at the time of listing. The lack of complete information does not negate the Serviceâ€™s statutory obligation to designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent and determinable. The designation aids in the conservation of the species by highlighting areas that are important for the species' recovery and by informing landowners and managers, as well as the public, of the importance of these areas."

4. **Climate change**: Changes in temperature, ocean acidification, and altered rainfall patterns can impact aquatic habitats profoundly, affecting the survival of species.
5. **Invasive species**: Non-native species can become predators, competitors, or bring diseases that native species like Elliptoideus sloatianus are not equipped to handle.
6. **Disease**: Epidemics can have devastating effects on species with limited or declining populations.

For accurate threats to Elliptoideus sloatianus, consulting scientific literature, conservation status reports, or specific databases like the IUCN Red List could provide detailed insights."
81,Elliptio lanceolata,"The identified threats for *Elliptio lanceolata* (Yellow Lance) include:

1. **Habitat Degradation**: The decline of *Elliptio lanceolata* correlates with habitat degradation resulting from cumulative impacts of land use change and watershed-level effects on water quality and quantity, habitat connectivity, and instream habitat quality.

2. **Pollution**: Pollution was highlighted as one of the stressors anticipated to impact the population resilience of Yellow Lance, indicating its potential to contribute to habitat degradation and diminish the species' viability.

3. **Reduced Stream Flow**: Decreases in stream flow were noted as a critical factor that would negatively affect the species. Changes in water flow can significantly impact habitat conditions, affecting the mussel's ability to survive and reproduce.

4. **Habitat Fragmentation**: Continued habitat fragmentation poses a threat to Yellow Lance populations by isolating them further, which can reduce genetic diversity, hinder reproductive success, and limit the species' ability to withstand environmental changes.

5. **Climate Change**: The effects of climate change, such as increasing temperatures and more frequent or severe droughts, have begun to impact the Yellow Lance's range and may further contribute to habitat degradation. These effects could exacerbate other threats like reduced water flow and pollution.

6. **Potential in Increased Urbanization and Land Use Change**: The predicted negative changes to habitat requirements such as water quality, flow, and riparian conditions under future scenarios suggest that increased urbanization and changes in land use could threaten the Yellow Lance by altering its natural habitat.

7. **Interbasin Water Transfer**: Although not directly mentioned as a historical threat, the mention of emerging scenarios, including interbasin transfer, implies a concern for future water management practices that could affect the species' habitats by altering natural water flow patterns and availability.

These threats contribute to the reduction in abundance, distribution, and overall resilience of *Elliptio lanceolata*, indicating a significant conservation concern for ensuring the species' long-term viability."
82,Elliptio lanceolata,"Based on the text, the identified threats to *Elliptio lanceolata* (Yellow Lance) include a range of environmental and anthropogenic (human-induced) factors that have contributed to the species' decline. These threats have led to significant habitat degradation, which is a critical concern for the viability of the species. The main identified threats include:

1. **Water Quality Degradation**: Pollution from various sources has impacted the water quality of habitats where Yellow Lance resides. Poor water quality can affect the mussels' ability to feed, reproduce, and survive.

2. **Water Quantity Reduction**: Changes in water flow, possibly due to water withdrawals, damming, or altered hydrology, can significantly impact Yellow Lance populations. Such alterations can lead to habitat loss or change, affecting mussel populations.

3. **Habitat Connectivity Loss**: Loss of connectivity between habitats can prevent gene flow between populations, reduce the availability of suitable habitats, and limit the species' ability to recolonize areas.

4. **Instream Habitat Quality Decline**: The quality of the substrate and overall instream habitat is crucial for the Yellow Lance. Degradation of these habitats, whether through sedimentation, direct physical alteration, or other means, impacts their survival and reproductive success.

5. **Climate Change**: The effects of climate change, including increasing temperatures and potential for more frequent droughts, can exacerbate existing threats and contribute to habitat degradation over time.

6. **Land Use Change and Watershed-level Effects**: Cumulative impacts of land use changes (e.g., urbanization, agriculture) can negatively affect water quality and quantity, as well as instream and riparian habitat quality, across the species' range.

7. **Fragmentation of Populations**: As habitats degrade and become fragmented, populations of Yellow Lance become isolated, decreasing the species' overall resilience, redundancy, and representation. This isolation can lead to decreased genetic diversity and increased vulnerability to extinction.

These threats contribute to a decline in the species' abundance and distribution, resulting in a significant reduction of its historical range. The Yellow Lance now occupies approximately 43% of its historical range, with many remaining populations being small, fragmented, and largely isolated, making the species more vulnerable to extinction. To improve the species' viability, conservation efforts must address these identified threats by improving water quality, maintaining water quantity, enhancing habitat connectivity and quality, and mitigating the impacts of climate change and land use changes."

84,Epioblasma obliquata,"The identified threats for **Epioblasma obliquata obliquata** as gleaned from the provided text include:

1. **Habitat Degradation**: The Killbuck Creek watershed, where the species is found, is predominantly agricultural, with numerous oil and gas wells, leading to concerns about water quality and habitat suitability for the mussel and its host fish.

2. **Low Population Density and Restricted Range**: The long-term viability of the Killbuck Creek population is questionable due to very small population size and concentration in one riffle, posing a genetic bottleneck threat that may impede long-term population stability and resilience.

3. **Potential for Climate Change Effects**: Stochastic events such as spills and potential effects of climate change, including flooding, droughts, and increased water temperatures, are not ruled out and could further threaten the species.

4. **Low Genetic Variation**: Little to no genetic variation observed in the population, indicating that the Killbuck Creek population has been through a recent bottleneck. Although heterozygosity and allelic richness values are moderately low (not extremely), indicating some presence of genetic diversity, the population still faces genetic concerns affecting its long-term viability.

5. **Agricultural Activities in the Watershed**: Agricultural activities within the watershed pose a risk to water quality and habitat condition, which are critical for the survival and reproduction of the species. This threat encompasses not only direct habitat degradation but also indirect effects on food availability and host fish populations.

6. **Oil and Gas Extraction Wells and Pipelines**: The presence of oil and gas extraction infrastructure can introduce pollutants and sediments into water bodies, leading to further degradation of the mussel's habitat.

7. **Lack of Natural Recruitment in Reintroduced Populations**: Although reintroduction efforts are ongoing, natural reproduction has not yet been documented in any of the reintroduced populations, leaving these populations vulnerable and not self-sustaining.

8. **High Sediment Load**: High sediment load, particularly during high surface flows, can impact visibility and, by extension, the ability of researchers to monitor the population, but more significantly, excessive sediment can detrimentally affect mussel feeding, respiration, and overall habitat suitability.

Efforts to mitigate these threats include captive propagation, reintroduction projects, and habitat restoration (e.g., dam removals expected to restore sections of streams to free-flowing systems) to increase the amount of available habitat for the species and its host fish. However, at the time of the review, many of the recovery criteria have not been met, indicating ongoing threats to the species' survival."
85,Cicurina baronia,"The identified threats to Cicurina baronia, also known as the Robber Baron Cave meshweaver, include habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation primarily resulting from urban development. This species of eyeless, troglobitic spider is endemic to a restricted range in the karst landscape of northern Bexar County, Texas, where it inhabits dark, moist areas of caves and other subterranean voids that provide stable temperatures and high humidity. The karst terrain, essential for the spider's survival, is susceptible to the impacts of urbanization which can lead to alterations in the hydrology, pollution of water sources, and physical destruction of the cave systems and surrounding habitats crucial for the spider and the specialised ecosystems they support.

Urban development leads to numerous stressors including the potential for increased flooding, contamination by pollutants, alterations in subterranean and surface water flow, and may also facilitate the invasion of species such as the red-imported fire ant which can affect native species populations and ecosystem dynamics. The spider requires intact networks of subterranean voids for living space and to act as a buffer or refugia from the effects of humidity and temperature extremes. Functional surface and subsurface drainage basins are crucial for supplying water that helps maintain the high relative humidity necessary for the species.

Given the spider's specific habitat requirements, conservation efforts focus on the delineation, protection, and management of occupied karst fauna areas (KFAs). To ensure the long-term viability of species like the Robber Baron Cave meshweaver, it is essential to preserve sufficiently large and properly configured areas of habitat that are protected from the adverse impacts of urbanization and other threats. These efforts must include maintaining the integrity of the karst ecosystem upon which the species depends, including providing adequate quality and quantity of moisture, maintaining stable cave temperatures, reducing predation or competition from invasive species, providing adequate nutrient input, and ensuring a high probability of viable population persistence."

6. **Possibly Genetic Factors**: The small and isolated populations may face genetic challenges, such as inbreeding depression, which can further contribute to the decline.

The recovery and protection efforts for Mitchell's satyr butterfly would need to address these key threats strategically to ensure its conservation and survival."
91,Alasmidonta raveneliana,"The identified threats for Alasmidonta raveneliana (Appalachian elktoe) based on the summarized analysis and evaluation include:

1. **Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Habitat or Range (Factor A):** This encompasses impoundments and general deterioration of habitat and water quality resulting from siltation and pollutants due to poor land use practices and toxic discharges. The species suffers from limited distribution and isolation into disconnected habitats, restricting gene flow and natural range expansion.
   
2. **The Insufficiency of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms (Factor D):** Although existing regulatory mechanisms protect Appalachian elktoe from intentional harm, they are inadequate in protecting the watersheds where these mussels reside. Activities contributing to erosion and turbidity in waterways are often not closely monitored for compliance, undermining the health of habitats crucial for the species' survival.

3. **Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence (Factor E):** This includes the speciesâ€™ geographic and demographic challenges due to its isolation into small populations, which hampers genetic diversity and adaptability. Human-mediated factors, such as erosion from land disturbances anywhere within the species' watershed, have been linked to recent population declines. This threat is compounded by lack of gene flow between populations, rendering the species highly susceptible to local extirpations.

The review explicitly points out that the overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes (Factor B) and disease or predation (Factor C) are not currently recognized as significant threats to the speciesâ€™ survival. However, it mentions that predation by mammals like muskrats could affect populations locally but seems to be a minor factor compared to habitat destruction and inadequacies in regulatory protection. Disease is also hypothesized as a potential, yet unconfirmed, factor in population declines.

The overall assessment emphasizes the critical need for continuous assessment, habitat protection, and management efforts to ensure the survival and recovery of the Appalachian elktoe populations."
92,Epioblasma metastriata,"Based on the review documents provided for **Epioblasma metastriata** (Upland Combshell), the identified threats that led to its presumed extinction include:

1. **Habitat Loss and Degradation**: Past documentation suggests a significant loss and degradation of habitat within its historical range due to various factors such as pollution, dam construction, and alteration of river flows. These activities have negatively impacted the quality and availability of suitable habitats for Epioblasma metastriata.

3. **Pollution**: Water pollution from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and urbanization has been a major concern. Pollutants can directly harm mussels or degrade the quality of their habitat, affecting their survival.

4. **Invasive Species**: The introduction and expansion of invasive species can also pose a threat by outcompeting native mussels for food and habitat, or by altering the ecological balance of their environments.

5. **Lack of Recovery Efforts**: At the time of listing and during subsequent reviews, there was a notable absence of specific recovery criteria for Epioblasma metastriata, largely due to the extent of its decline and challenges in habitat protection and restoration. This absence of targeted recovery efforts may have hindered the species' conservation.

6. **Limited Knowledge on Species' Ecology and Management Needs**: The review mentioned a lack of detailed information on the habitat and life history needs, host fish, and effective management strategies for the species. This lack of knowledge can significantly obstruct conservation and recovery initiatives.

The synthesis in the documents concludes that despite extensive surveys in the historical range, no live specimens of Epioblasma metastriata have been found for several years, leading to the presumption of extinction. While other federally listed mussel species have been detected during these surveys, the absence of Epioblasma metastriata suggests its likely disappearance due to the combined effects of the identified threats and possibly other unidentified factors."

1. **Groundwater Contamination:** Human-related activities present the greatest threat to the Kentucky Cave Shrimp, primarily through contamination of groundwater sources. This includes pollutants associated with agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and other sources that can quickly enter groundwater basins and adversely affect shrimp populations by directly impacting individuals, degrading habitats, and reducing food resources.

2. **Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms:** While certain protections exist, such as those afforded by the Clean Water Act and specific Kentucky laws and regulations, these mechanisms have not been adequate in preventing the impacts of groundwater contamination on the Kentucky Cave Shrimp and its habitat.

3. **Vulnerability Due to Low Abundance and Restricted Distribution:** The shrimp's low relative abundance and limited distribution within specific groundwater basins make it particularly vulnerable to catastrophic contamination events, habitat modifications, non-point-source pollutants, and natural catastrophic changes (e.g., flood scour, drought). Such events could lead to local extirpations of the species.

4. **Genetic Isolation and Reduced Fitness:** The potential limited natural interchange of genetic material between populations due to the species' restricted distribution may lead to inbreeding depression and reduced fitness of individuals. Some cave shrimp populations might be below the effective population size required to maintain long-term genetic and population viability.

5. **Climate Change:** The expected impacts of climate change, including changes in water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, recharge rates, altered hydrological regimes, groundwater levels, and quality, could directly affect Kentucky Cave Shrimp habitats. Additionally, increases in extreme weather events could increase groundwater contamination risks.

6. **Other Natural or Manmade Factors:** Besides direct threats, the species is also susceptible to challenges like potential predation (although specific predators like trout stocking near habitats have ceased) and diseases, though these are not considered major threats compared to habitat contamination and inadequate regulatory mechanisms.

In light of these threats, the review concluded that the Kentucky Cave Shrimp continues to meet the definition of endangered under the Endangered Species Act, recommending no change to its current classification."

5. **Disease**: Diseases can impact small populations significantly, leading to declines or extirpation. Managing and mitigating disease risks are vital for the recovery of *Hylaeus anthracinus*.

6. **Impaired Water Quality and Flow**: For species that depend on specific habitat conditions, changes in water quality and availability can directly affect their survival by altering their habitats and the availability of food sources.

Efforts to stabilize the populations of *Hylaeus anthracinus* include research to inform adaptive management strategies, protection from specific threats including habitat degradation from a variety of sources, predation, loss of host plants, competition, disease, impaired water quality, and flow. Establishing captive rearing programs and conservation translocation could also be strategies to prevent extinction and bolster populations of *Hylaeus anthracinus*."
