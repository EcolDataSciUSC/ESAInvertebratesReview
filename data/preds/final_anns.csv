29,29,2338,Gastropoda,Lepyrium showalteri,ReviewURLs,https://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/2353.pdf,Based on the detailed recovery analysis for Lepyrium showalteri Flat Pebblesnail and other aquatic snails in the Mobile River Basin identified threats include Habitat Destruction and Modification Factor A The text highlights the impact of impoundments which have led to habitat loss fragmentation and alteration of stream channels Even though no new impoundments are pending that would directly affect recovery habitats for these snails historical impacts from such modifications remain a concern Additionally the removal of impediments like the Marvel Slab and remnants of an old railroad bridge has benefited snail populations by removing barriers and thereby potentially reducing habitat fragmentation Water Quality Part of Factors A and E Water quality remains a critical concern Eutrophication and sedimentation have been significant threats to these snail species preventing them from expanding into portions of their historical habitat Examples include the documented effects of nutrient enrichment on reintroduction sites for the Plicate Rocksnail as well as other listed snails impacting water quality and substrate conditions critical for the snails survival Several stream segments within the habitats of these snails are listed on the states d list of impaired water bodies for nutrients siltation and other habitat alterations indicating ongoing water quality issues Stream Stability Factor A The document presents concerns about the stability of stream channels and adjacent riparian zones While many sites inhabited by these snails are relatively stable no rigorous analysis has been conducted to evaluate stream channel stability fully Consequently issues like excessive bank erosion or stream channel degradationaggradation could still pose threats to these snails habitats Impacts from Impoundments and Dams Factor A Although the document mentions the lack of pending permits for new impoundments within the critical habitats for these snails existing dams and reservoirs such as the construction of the Duck River Reservoir could still affect stream flow water quality and sediment transport processes directly impacting snail habitats Pollution and Nutrient Enrichment Factor A The analysis points out specific incidents where sites for conservation action like reintroduction efforts were negatively affected by eutrophic conditions illustrating the broader threat of pollution and nutrient enrichment on these speciesIn summary the identified threats for Lepyrium showalteri and other snails in the Mobile River Basin encompass habitat destruction and modification water quality

also known as the Round Rocksnail based on the information provided include Habitat Destruction Modification or Curtailment Listing Factor A The original and current threats to Leptoxis ampla include the destruction modification or curtailment of its habitat This species like many aquatic snails in the Mobile River Basin has declined due to a variety of impacts on streams and their watersheds Specifically habitat loss and fragmentation due to impoundment were major causes of decline for these snails Although there is one ongoing impoundment project mentioned there are no new or pending permits or applications for constructing impoundments within recovery habitats which suggests ongoing concerns about habitat modification Water Quality Listing Factor A Water pollution is believed to have contributed to the disappearance of snail populations from unimpounded portions of their historic habitat The text mentions degraded water quality particularly due to sedimentation and eutrophication currently preventing these species from expanding into portions of their historical habitat The presence of harmful algal blooms nutrient enrichment and sedimentation could significantly impact the water quality posing a threat to the survival of Leptoxis ampla Stable Stream Channels and Adequately Vegetated Riparian Zones Listing Factor A The stability of stream channels and the condition of adjacent riparian zones are important for the survival of aquatic species including Leptoxis ampla The document mentions that most sites inhabited by these six species implicitly including Leptoxis ampla are relatively stable but no rigorous analysis has been conducted on channel conditions This suggests a potential threat from unstable stream channels and inadequately vegetated riparian zones which could affect water quality and habitat suitability for Leptoxis ampla Impacts from Impoundments and Infrastructure Projects Listing Factor A There is a mention of impoundments such as the Duck River Reservoir project and the removal of impoundments like the Marvel Slab While removal of some impoundments benefitted certain snail species by improving densities the creation of new reservoirs poses a threat by altering habitats through impoundment and associated infrastructure developments Total Maximum Daily Loads TMDLs for Pollutants Listing Factor A The establishment of TMDLs for pollutants such as phosphorous siltation and E coli in river basins including the Cahaba and Coosa Rivers indicates ongoing water quality issues While efforts to reduce pollutants may benefit Leptoxis ampla the existence of such pollutants highlights the threat of water quality degradation to its survivalIn summary Leptoxis ampla faces threats primarily

Lacy Elimia based on the provided text are as follows Declining Populations Elimia crenatella has been identified as declining in the review From originally being found in Cheaha Emauhee and Weewoka Creeks surveys have failed to document populations in Emauhee or Weewoka leaving Elimia crenatella persisting only in Cheaha Creek Habitat Destruction or Modification Factor A Threats to the species habitat due to activities that may lead to the destruction modification or curtailment of its habitat are implied through the general habitat requirements and threats listed for all six species under review This includes impacts upon streams and their watersheds such as impoundment which was a major cause of decline for these six snails Though specific actions like the removal of impediments eg the removal of Marvel Slab and remnants of an old rail car bridge have been beneficial the threats of habitat destruction or modifications are significant Water Quality ListingRecovery Factor Criteria Deteriorating water quality particularly due to siltation and eutrophication prevents these species from expanding into portions of their historical habitat This indicates a direct threat to Elimia crenatella considering that water quality degradation from various pollutants eg phosphorous and siltation for Coosa River Basin is highlighted as a concern for the habitat of the discussed snails Impact of Impoundments Although the review points out there are no new or pending permit applications for constructing impoundments within critical recovery habitats historical impoundments have been a major cause of decline Though some beneficial actions have been taken such as the removal of certain impediments improving conditions for related species the overall impact of past impoundments continues to be a concern for the stable habitat conditions necessary for Elimia crenatellas survival Inadequate Channel Stability and Riparian Vegetation Factor A The majority of sites inhabited by these six species are relatively stable but there hasnt been a rigorous analysis on channel stability or geomorphic trends Inadequate channel stability and insufficiently vegetated riparian zones can contribute to habitat degradation affecting Elimia crenatella Total Maximum Daily Load TMDL Issues The establishment of TMDLs for pollutants within the basins important to these snails implies that pollution levels are threatening their habitats High levels of specific contaminants necessitating TMDLs suggest a direct threat to the water quality of habitats occupied by Elimia crenatellaIn summary Elimia crenatella is threatened by a combination of factors leading to habitat decline including direct habitat modification or destruction declining water quality from pollutants and the

impacted the species status Natural threats Implied through the concern for protection against foreseeable anthropogenic and natural threats though not explicitly detailed natural threats could involve changes in water quality climate change impacts or catastrophic natural events that could affect the mussels survival Insufficient genetic variation The recovery plan defines a viable population as one that maintains sufficient genetic variation to evolve and respond to natural habitat changes hinting at the threat posed by reduced genetic diversity within small or isolated populations Limited distribution and density The Alabama lampmussels rarity and low density coupled with its limited distribution within specific river systems suggest the species is at risk from single adverse events that could significantly affect its populations Reintroduction success and recruitment While not a direct threat the uncertainty surrounding the success of reintroduction efforts

identified threats for Lampsilis higginsii Higgins Eye Pearlymussel are multifaceted involving various direct and indirect factors that affect its survival and sustainability These threats can be elucidated by examining different sections of the review particularly those discussing Essential Habitat Areas EHA recovery criteria and specific factors under the Endangered Species Act The threats include Zebra Mussels Dreissena polymorpha The presence and density of zebra mussels are repeatedly identified as a significant threat Zebra mussels can overgrow and suffocate native mussel populations including the Higgins Eye leading to declined populations Their presence is a direct threat under factor E Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence Habitat Degradation and Stability The stability of habitat and its ability to support dense and diverse mussel communities are crucial for the Higgins Eye Unstable habitats with changing substrate composition due to factors like zebra mussel infestation can threaten the species survival addressing factor A The present or threatened destruction modification or curtailing of its habitat or range Water Quality and Toxicity The need to develop measurable water quality criteria for Lampsilis higginsii highlights the threat from poor water quality including sediment quality This encompasses pollution and runoff that may carry harmful substances into the mussels habitats impacting their health and reproductive success This aspect touches on factor A and potentially factor E Low Population Density and Reproductive Success The survival of Higgins Eye populations requiring certain thresholds of population density and evidence of reproduction points to the threat from historically low numbers and the challenges in achieving selfsustaining populations This situation encapsulates factors related to ecological resilience and redundancy which are pivotal in the species ability to withstand environmental changes and stochastic events Commercial Harvesting of Freshwater Mussels Although not directly specified as a current threat to Lampsilis higginsii within EHAs since some states have

identified threats for Lampsilis higginsii Higgins eye pearlymussel include Zebra Mussel Infestation The continuing presence and impact of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha in the upper Mississippi River and other occupied habitats of Lampsilis higginsii pose a significant threat Zebra mussels compete with native mussel species for food and space and they have been known to attach to the shells of native mussels in large numbers potentially leading to the native mussels death Habitat Modification and Pollution The species requires specific water quality and substrate conditions to thrive Any changes in water quality characteristics such as harmful concentrations of pollutants like unionized ammonia or alterations to the physical habitat eg changes that result in unstable substrate conditions could appreciably reduce the likelihood of conserving Higgins eye populations This threat encompasses activities that could lead to detrimental effects on the species habitat like construction projects or spills that alter water quality and the physical environment Inadequate Regulatory Protection Although some states have taken steps to prohibit commercial freshwater mussel harvest not all states within the range of Higgins eye have enacted such protections Additionally Higgins eye habitat information and protective measures have not been fully incorporated into spill contingency planning efforts and other relevant management actions This points to a need for more robust and comprehensive regulatory mechanisms to adequately protect the species and its habitat Threats from Zebra Mussels Remaining Unaddressed The threat posed by zebra mussels specifically is not fully mitigated as their presence continues to threaten existing populations by potentially affecting the longevity and reproductive success of Higgins eye in several critical habitats Lack of a SelfSustaining Populations in Key Areas The goal of having five essential habitats containing reproducing and selfsustaining populations of Higgins eye that are not threatened by zebra mussels has not been met signifying ongoing threats to the species recovery and conservation Commercial

throughout the text are mainly related to habitat degradation and fragmentation among other concerns that are common to the species discussed Specifically for Fusconaia escambia and comparable mussel species within the same habitat regions the primary threats can be summarized as follows Habitat Degradation and Loss    Habitat degradation including alteration of river flow and stability due to dam construction agricultural runoff urbanization and logging activities These can significantly impact the sediment quality and water flow necessary for the survival of Fusconaia escambia For instance the construction of Point A Dam and Gantt Dam has effectively isolated certain river drainage areas impacting the species habitats Pollution    Exposure to contaminants such as DDT dioxinlike PCBs and potentially other chemicals lingering in mainstem sediments poses a risk to the mussels These pollutants can accumulate in the aquatic environment and have harmful effects on the mussels health and reproductive capacities Limited Distribution and Low Population Density    While not a direct threat the limited distribution and low population densities make the species more vulnerable to extinction risks from stochastic events or localized threats The Narrow Pigtoe appears to exist in low densities relative to other native mussel species indicating potential risk factors for its survival Salt Water Intrusion    For species residing in estuarine environments or those close to the coast salt water intrusion into freshwater habitats can be a significant threat This phenomenon can be exacerbated by water withdrawal for municipal and agricultural uses reducing the freshwater flow necessary to maintain a suitable habitat for freshwater mussels Climate Change    Projected changes in climate patterns including increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods can further destabilize the already vulnerable habitats of Fusconaia escambia and other similar species Climate change can affect water temperature flow regimes and the overall ecohydrology of the rivers these species inhabit Impaired Water Quality    Water quality issues stemming from point and nonpoint source pollution including agricultural runoff untreated wastewater and industrial discharges can significantly impact the species health and reduce habitat quality Host Specialization    For mussels that are host specialists for their larval stage development any decline in the host fish population can directly impact their ability to reproduce and maintain population levelsThese threats are interconnected and their impacts are compounded by the interdependencies within the aquatic ecosystems Habitat degradation in combination with pollution and other stresses presents significant risks to the survival of Fusconaia escambia and underscores the need for comprehensive conservation and management actions tailored to addressing these challenges,True,,identified threat fusconaia

about the Carolina heelsplitter Lasmigona decorata there are several identified threats to the species viability across various populations and river systems Here are key identified threats distilled from the detailed report Small and Isolated Populations Most of the surviving populations of the Carolina heelsplitter are described as either small or extremely small posing a significant threat to their genetic health and overall viability Small population sizes are highly susceptible to stochastic events and genetic drift which can reduce genetic diversity and the species ability to adapt to environmental changes Habitat Fragmentation The distribution of the species is noted to be patchy and highly fragmented in regions such as the Lynches River contributing to isolation of populations Habitat fragmentation often resulting from human activities like urban development and agriculture impedes the movement of individuals between populations further limiting genetic exchange and increasing vulnerability to localized extinctions Drought and Water Quality Several populations continue to be affected by recurring severe to extreme drought conditions which can lead to habitat desiccation reduced water quality and increased susceptibility to pollutants Prolonged drought conditions have previously caused significant mussel mortality and could further threaten the survival of these populations Siltation and Habitat Degradation Heavy siltation possibly as a result of construction and poor land use practices coats rocks and stream bottoms deteriorating habitat quality necessary for the survival of the Carolina heelsplitter Habitat degradation including changes in water flow due to development and pollution from urban runoff and wastewater treatment plant discharges is a significant threat to the persistence of the species in affected streams Low Reproductive Success and Limited Young Individuals The detection of relatively few young individuals across several populations suggests limited reproductive success which is a critical concern for the species future Successful reproduction is essential for maintaining population sizes and ensuring genetic diversity Vulnerability to Single or Chronic Events Due to the small size and isolated nature of the populations many are highly susceptible to extirpation from single catastrophic events eg chemical spills or chronic events eg prolonged drought continuous habitat degradation This vulnerability is exacerbated by the species limited distribution and habitat specificityOverall the main threats to

affecting Lasmigona subviridis are  Habitat Loss or Fragmentation This is primarily due to development energy production agriculture and other anthropogenic activities leading to the physical alteration or destruction of their natural habitat  Changes in Water Flows Alterations due to damming water withdrawal for agricultural or human consumption and similar activities can significantly impact the habitats suitability by affecting the flow rates that are crucial for their survival  Degraded Water Quality Pollution from agricultural runoff sewage discharge industrial pollutants and other sources contribute to poor water quality impacting the health and reproductive success of Lasmigona subviridis  Invasive Species Although not directly correlated with the current condition of the species through the analysis the presence of invasive species such as the rusty crayfish poses potential threats possibly due to predation or competition  Predation While not identified as a major current stressor predation including potential increased risks from invasive species could impact populations especially if other factors have already weakened them  Climate Change Changes in climate can exacerbate existing threats such as habitat fragmentation water regime alterations and water quality issues alongside introducing new challenges  Lack of Genetic Exchange Connectivity between populations is essential for periodic genetic exchange Barriers such as dams can limit this affecting the resilience and adaptive capacity of the species Future Projections and Increased Risks

sensitive to changes in dissolved oxygen pH salinity and temperature among other water quality parameters In the portion of Rio Grande inhabited by the Salina mucket and Mexican fawnsfoot water quality is influenced by wastewater discharges agricultural runoff urban runoff and natural processesWater quality in the Rio Grande is influenced by numerous factors including wastewater discharge from urban areas both in the United States and Mexico Rapid population growth and industrialization particularly in the Mexican side of the border has stressed existing wastewater treatment facilities leading to high sediment loads and impaired water quality downstream Agricultural activities including irrigation return flows also contribute nutrients pesticides and other contaminants to the river Urban development leads to increased impervious surfaces altering runoff patterns and increasing pollutant loads during rain events Additionally natural processes can affect water quality for example evaporation can concentrate salts in the river increasing salinity levels and affecting mussel viabilityHydrologic Alteration and Loss of FlowChanges in natural flow regimes can have significant impacts on freshwater mussels affecting their growth reproduction and survival Hydrologic alterations in the Rio Grande including water diversion for irrigation and urban uses reservoir operations and channel modifications for flood control and navigation have altered the natural flow and thermal regimes to which these mussels and their host fish are adapted Impoundments create barriers to fish movement and change upstream and downstream flow patterns impacting mussel dispersal and recruitment Reduced flows can lead to habitat fragmentation and isolation increased water temperatures decreased dissolved oxygen levels and impaired water quality all of which can be detrimental to freshwater mussel populationsBarriers to Fish MovementFreshwater mussels rely on specific fish species for the dispersal of their larvae glochidia Barriers such as dams weirs and culverts can impede the movement of host fish limiting mussel dispersal and gene flow between populations For Mexican fawnsfoot which has specialized relationships with molluscivorous fish like freshwater drum barriers to fish movement can particularly limit the species ability to recolonize areas after local extirpations or stochastic events Disruption of these hostparasite relationships due to impaired fish movement can have significant impacts on population dynamics and genetic diversity of

sensitive to changes in dissolved oxygen pH salinity and temperature among other water quality parameters In the portion of Rio Grande inhabited by the Salina mucket and Mexican fawnsfoot water quality is influenced by wastewater discharges agricultural runoff urban runoff and natural processesWater quality in the Rio Grande is influenced by numerous factors including wastewater discharge from urban areas both in the United States and Mexico Rapid population growth and industrialization particularly in the Mexican side of the border has stressed existing wastewater treatment facilities leading to high sediment loads and impaired water quality downstream Agricultural activities including irrigation return flows also contribute nutrients pesticides and other contaminants to the river Urban development leads to increased impervious surfaces altering runoff patterns and increasing pollutant loads during rain events Additionally natural processes can affect water quality for example evaporation can concentrate salts in the river increasing salinity levels and affecting mussel viabilityHydrologic Alteration and Loss of FlowChanges in natural flow regimes can have significant impacts on freshwater mussels affecting their growth reproduction and survival Hydrologic alterations in the Rio Grande including water diversion for irrigation and urban uses reservoir operations and channel modifications for flood control and navigation have altered the natural flow and thermal regimes to which these mussels and their host fish are adapted Impoundments create barriers to fish movement and change upstream and downstream flow patterns impacting mussel dispersal and recruitment Reduced flows can lead to habitat fragmentation and isolation increased water temperatures decreased dissolved oxygen levels and impaired water quality all of which can be detrimental to freshwater mussel populationsBarriers to Fish MovementFreshwater mussels rely on specific fish species for the dispersal of their larvae glochidia Barriers such as dams weirs and culverts can impede the movement of host fish limiting mussel dispersal and gene flow between populations For Mexican fawnsfoot which has specialized relationships with molluscivorous fish like freshwater drum barriers to fish movement can particularly limit the species ability to recolonize areas after local extirpations or stochastic events Disruption of these hostparasite relationships due to impaired fish movement can have significant impacts on population dynamics and genetic diversity of musselsClimate ChangeOngoing and expected effects of climate change including increased frequency and severity of droughts altered precipitation patterns leading to changes in flow regimes and increases in temperature exacerbate other threats such as habitat loss water quality degradation and hydrologic alteration Climate change can lead to more extreme weather events altering the natural disturbance regimes that mussels and their ecosystems have adapted to Reduced streamflow and increased water temperatures can stress mussel populations directly and indirectly by affecting host fish viability and changing community dynamics Climate change may also facilitate the spread of nonnative species and diseases further impacting freshwater mussel populationsConservation EffortsVarious conservation efforts are underway to address the threats to Salina mucket and Mexican fawnsfoot including habitat restoration water quality improvement projects and research on freshwater mussel biology and ecology Collaboration between state federal and international agencies as well as nongovernmental organizations and academic institutions is critical to the success of these efforts

Cumberland moccasinshell as well as for the Tennessee clubshell Pleurobema oviforme and the Tennessee pigtoe Pleuronaia barnesiana can be summarized as follows Habitat Requirements All three species prefer riffles runs shoals and high gradient streams with stable substrates dominated by coarse sand gravel and cobble These specific habitat preferences make them vulnerable to any alterations in stream morphology and substrate composition Demographic Parameters Estimates for age at sexual maturity are similar across all three species  years indicating a potential vulnerability to factors that affect longterm survival and recruitment Host Fish Utilization They are capable of using multiple host fishes including several shiners and darters that are relatively common throughout their range Any threat to these host fish populations could have direct adverse effects on the mussels lifecycle Resilience to Extirpation The assessment classified watersheds based on the probability of persistence over  years which essentially reflects a populations resilience Low condition populations have inherently high risks of becoming extirpated within several generations Impact of LandUse and Climate Patterns Historical land use and climate patterns were significant enough to serve as predictors for current population conditions This suggests that past and ongoing alterations to the landscape and climate variabilities pose substantial threats to these species Future Land Use and Climate Projections The model projected changes in extirpation risk based on future land use and climate scenarios It highlighted an already high baseline risk which could be exacerbated by additional threats such as chemical spills mining activities dieoff events or the introduction of nonnative species Range Reduction All species have experienced substantial range restrictions with potentially significant portions of their former range no longer occupied This loss of range reduces genetic diversity and interpopulation connectivity further elevating extinction risks Genetic Isolation Reduced connectivity between tributary populations contributes to genetic isolation and the loss of major habitat types like large river ecosystems which likely provided opportunities for gene flow between populations Localized Threats Sitespecific threats such as mining activities chemical spills and enigmatic dieoffs especially in parts of the Cumberland Basin and upper Tennessee that have been heavily impacted by coal mining activities present significant risks that the model may underestimateThese identified threats encompass a range of factors from specific habitat requirements and lifecycle vulnerabilities to broader landscape and climate change impacts all contributing to

experiencing stress from other factors such as drought reduced flow or increased sedimentation predation may have a more significant negative impactFreshwater mussels including the Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe can also be collected for scientific research species conservation activities or personal use eg as aquarium pets or for decorative purposes Although collection for commercial purposes eg for use in jewelry or as bait does not appear to be a significant threat currently unauthorized collection could impact small or isolated populations Collecting individuals from these already vulnerable populations could further reduce their viabilityIn summary direct mortality factors pose a threat to Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe populations particularly where these factors compound other stresses being experienced by the populationsClimate ChangeClimate change is expected to have various effects on freshwater mussel species including the Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe Projected changes include increased air and water temperatures altered precipitation patterns leading to both more severe droughts and flooding and longer periods of low flow in rivers and streams These changes can exacerbate already existing threats such as altered hydrology changes in water quality and habitat degradationIncreased temperatures and altered flow regimes can affect the physiological requirements of mussels and their host fish potentially impacting mussel reproduction and survival rates Warmer water temperatures can increase the metabolic rates of mussels requiring them to filter more water to meet their nutritional needs However if these conditions are coupled with degraded water quality the additional metabolic demand could stress the musselsLower stream flows can lead to the habitat becoming unsuitable for mussels due to reduced oxygen levels higher temperatures and increased concentration of pollutants On the other hand more extreme flooding can displace mussels from suitable habitats damage or destroy mussel beds and lead to increased sedimentation that can smother musselsOverall climate change is likely to increase the severity and frequency of existing threats to the Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe making their conservation more challenging in the futureConclusionThe primary threats to the Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe include changes to water quality altered hydrology changes to habitat structure and substrate and habitat fragmentation all of which are exacerbated by the ongoing and expected effects of climate change Additionally direct mortality factors like predation and unauthorized collection can further impact the already stressed populations of these species Effective conservation

as outlined in the provided text include Habitat Alteration The oyster mussel has been significantly impacted by human activities leading to habitat alteration This includes the following    Impoundments Though not as significant a factor for some species impoundments have generally contributed to habitat loss and alteration for mussels by changing river flow patterns which can directly impact the habitat and sediment deposition critical for mussel survival    Channelization Altering the natural course of streams and rivers channelization has disrupted mussel habitats by changing flow patterns substrate composition and connectivity among populations    Pollution and Sedimentation Pollution from various nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff waste discharge and other industrial activities along with sedimentation has degraded water quality and covered the riverbeds with sediment suffocating mussels and their food sources  Excessive Sediment Bed Loads The accumulation of smaller sediment particles changes the habitat in ways that are unsuitable for the mussels affecting their ability to filter feed and reproduce Changes in Turbidity and Increased Suspended Solids Increased turbidity and suspended solids primarily resulting from poor landuse practices and the lack of maintenance of best management practices have further degraded their habitats Pesticides The use of pesticides in agriculture and other areas contributes to water pollution directly impacting mussels through toxicity or indirectly through affecting their food sources Localized Impacts These include    Coal Mining Mining activities can lead to increased sedimentation and chemical pollution in water bodies    Gravel Mining The removal of gravel can alter streambeds destroy mussel habitat and increase turbidity and sedimentation    Reduced Water Quality Below Dams Dams can alter water temperature flow and quality impacting mussel survival    Developmental Activities and Water Withdrawal Urban development and water withdrawal for agriculture or human consumption can reduce the flow and quality of water in mussel habitats Impoundments and Alien Species Other threats include the construction of barriers such as dams which restrict the movement of host fish species and disrupt lifecycle processes and the introduction of alien species that can outcompete or predate upon mussels Vulnerability to Toxic Chemical Spills Due to their restricted ranges and low population levels even localized pollution events can have catastrophic impacts on remaining populations Genetic Isolation The fragmentation of populations leads to reduced genetic diversity which can make populations more susceptible to diseases and decrease their adaptability to environmental

also known as the Snuffbox mussel include Anthropogenic Destruction and Modification of Riverine Habitat This encompasses activities such as dams construction which can alter water flow and temperature restrict movement of host fish species and change sediment dynamics critical for mussel survival Channelization which modifies the natural river course for navigation flood control or land development purposes can also destroy or alter habitat in ways that are detrimental to the Snuffbox mussel Invasive Species The introduction and proliferation of nonnative species can have diverse negative effects on native freshwater mussels Invasive species may compete for food or space change the habitat in ways that are unfavorable for native mussels or directly predate on them Invasive zebra mussels for instance can attach to the shells of native mussels in large numbers impairing the native mussels ability to move feed and respire Pollution This threat includes chemical spills and municipal and industrial effluents that can degrade water quality Pollutants may directly toxify the aquatic environment or indirectly affect it by altering the abundance and types of algal and invertebrate communities that serve as food sources for mussels and their host fish Persistent pollutants can accumulate in sediments presenting longterm threats to mussel populations Fragmentation of Habitat and Isolation of Populations Anthropogenic activities that create barriers within aquatic systems such as dams and poorly designed road culverts can fragment populations This leads to reduced genetic diversity decreased resilience to environmental changes and increased vulnerability to extirpation due to stochastic events Chronic Effects of Environmental Degradation While acute threats can have immediate and visible impacts on Snuffbox populations chronic longterm degradation of aquatic ecosystems also poses a significant threat This can include ongoing pollution subtle changes in water chemistry and sustained lowlevel disturbances that gradually reduce the viability of habitats for mussels Lack of Understanding about SpeciesSpecific Requirements and Threats Although not a direct

328,328,2572,Bivalvia,Pegias fabula,ReviewURLs,https://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/2928.pdf,The identified threats for Pegias fabula the Littlewing Pearlymussel can be summarized as follows based on the information provided in the text Habitat Loss and Water Quality Deterioration The primary issues contributing to the imperilment of Pegias fabula include habitat loss and the deterioration of water quality resulting from various anthropogenic activities such as development agriculture and resource extraction Impoundments Damming and other forms of water impoundments alter the natural flow and ecosystem dynamics of rivers and streams negatively impacting the habitat of the Littlewing Pearlymussel Industrial and Municipal Pollution Discharge and runoff from industrial and municipal sources introduce harmful substances into the waterways negatively affecting water quality and the suitability of habitats for Pegias fabula Acid Mine Drainage The leakage of acidic water from mining sites leads to acidification of water bodies further degrading habitat quality and threatening the survival of the Littlewing Pearlymussel Siltation Erosion due to mining agriculture and construction activities contributes to increased sedimentation in water bodies This siltation can smother mussels and reduce the quality of the habitat for Pegias fabula by burying the substrate needed for attachment and feeding Foreseeable Threats to Populations The recovery plan for Pegias fabula notes that no foreseeable threats should exist that would likely threaten the survival of any of the populations for the species to be considered for delisting However the threats listed above are still present and significant across its historical range indicating that these threats are ongoing and have not been alleviated Disease and Parasites While not explicitly mentioned in the provided text diseases and parasites are common threats to freshwater mussels that can have significant impacts on populations especially those that are already vulnerable Limited Geographic Distribution and Population Isolation The very limited and fragmented distribution of the species increases its vulnerability to extinction due to stochastic events and reduces the potential for gene flow between populations potentially leading to inbreeding depression and decreased genetic variability Climate Change Although not explicitly listed in the text climate change is a pervasive threat to freshwater mussels through its impacts on water temperature hydrology and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events all of which can negatively affect Pegias fabula Host Species Decline The reliance of Pegias fabula on specific

Margaritifera hembeli Louisiana Pearlshell Mussel based on the provided text can be categorized into five factors traditionally used in assessing species under the Endangered Species Act ESA However the text directly outlines the following specific issues contributing to its threatened status Habitat Fragmentation and Modification The expansion and alteration of the mussels habitat due to human activities such as construction of reservoirs and other manmade impoundments For instance Lake Iatt in Grant Parish and Kincaid Reservoir in Rapides Parish are mentioned as physical barriers that potentially limit host fish passage and genetic interchange among mussel populations  Reduction in Population Size and Distribution Although the text suggests a general increase in the population size in certain areas it also indicates variability and declines in others Specific streams like Mack Branch in Rapides Parish and Clear Branch and Hudson Creek in Grant Parish which previously supported small populations of Louisiana Pearlshell Mussels no longer do This suggests a trend of possible population decline in areas that once harbored the species Genetic Isolation The genetic studies cited in the text indicate that populations of M hembeli are beginning to show signs of genetic isolation particularly in areas separated by physical barriers like Lake Iatt Genetic isolation can reduce genetic diversity making the species more vulnerable to other threats like disease or environmental change Evidence of Recent Population Bottlenecks The genetic analysis noted bottlenecks in populations like those in Little Bayou Clear Gray Creek and Jordan Creek A population bottleneck can significantly reduce genetic diversity negatively impacting the longterm viability of populations Unknown Longterm Population Trends The text highlights the difficulty in accurately determining population trends due to varying survey methodologies and coverage It is mentioned that the overall population trend for the Louisiana Pearlshell mussel remains unknown which complicates conservation efforts Limited Data on Key Biological Aspects The absence of information on aspects such as sex ratio juvenile recruitment and mortality rate is also an indirect threat Without this information understanding the natural dynamics of the species and effectively managing its recovery becomes challenging Environmental and Anthropogenic Impacts While not explicitly listed in the sections provided the implications of habitat fragmentation population isolation and uncertain population trends hint at broader environmental and anthropogenic pressures These could include pollution water quality degradation alteration of river hydrology and other landuse changes that threaten the mussels

Amphipod Stygobromus indentatus the identified threats impacting the species viability include Water Quality Degradation The report identifies changes to groundwater quality as a primary factor influencing the viability of Stygobromus indentatus It specifically mentions development and the increase of impervious surfaces as a key source of water quality degradation which in turn negatively impacts the amphipod The concern is that runoff and pollution from developed areas can infiltrate groundwater and alter the chemical balance of habitats necessary for the species survival Water Quantity Alongside water quality the quantity of water is a crucial factor for the species persistence The report outlines that regulatory programs influencing groundwater withdrawal can impact water levels The species depends on shallow groundwater habitats and any significant alteration in water availability due to consumption diversion or changes in precipitation patterns could threaten their habitats Land Use Changes Development and changes in land use are directly tied to both water quality and quantity but also represent a broader threat to habitat availability and integrity Development leads to habitat loss fragmentation and changes in the hydrological regimes crucial for the Tidewater Amphipod This includes the increase of impervious surfaces which alters natural groundwater recharge rates and can lead to the drying up of critical habitat Climate Change While the report did not detail specific impacts from climate change the mention of future conditions analysis considering climate scenarios implies that changes in temperature precipitation patterns and sealevel rise could alter the habitats of Stygobromus indentatus These changes could further stress water quality and quantity and potentially shift the distribution of suitable habitats Stochastic Events The report mentions the species need for redundancy to withstand catastrophic events This implies that events such as severe weather pollution spills or disease outbreaks are potential threats to the species Given its limited known distribution and specialized habitat requirements any localized disaster could significantly impact its populations Potential Impacts from Other Factors Although not explicitly detailed as significant in the reports summary other factors such as predation disease recreational activities forest management and conservation efforts are explored While these were determined to have little to no measurable impact on the species they are still recognized as potential threats that could interact with the primary threats mentioned above Limited Understanding and Uncertainty One underlying threat to the species is the limited definitive knowledge about its biology habitat needs and population structure This makes it challenging to fully assess the impacts of identified threats and to develop precise conservation strategiesThe Tidewater Amphipod faces a combination of threats primarily centered around changes to its aquatic habitat quality and availability compounded by the impacts of human development and potentially climate change Addressing these

the text the identified threats to the Hines Emerald Dragonfly Somatochlora hineana primarily revolve around the challenges related to habitat protection management and the distribution and status of the populations Although the detailed threats are not directly listed in the provided text they can be inferred from the context and specific elements of information mentioned regarding habitat and population criteria Here are the identified or implied threats Habitat Destruction and Fragmentation The detailed information on the protection and management status of various sites along with concerns about subpopulation sizes and genetic isolation implies that habitat destruction and fragmentation are significant threats The need for legally protected and managed habitats signals ongoing challenges with habitat degradation including both direct destruction and habitat fragmentation that may impede the movement and genetic exchange among subpopulations Insufficient Legal Protection and Management Several sites list populations as only Partially Protected or mention a lack of delineation or protection This indicates that not all critical habitats are fully protected under current regulations or effectively managed for the conservation of the species Ineffective or incomplete legal protection could lead to continued or increased pressures from development pollution or other anthropogenic factors Limited Genetic Exchange The recovery plans criterion defining populations by a low probability of genetic exchange due to large distances highlights the threat of genetic isolation This isolation can reduce genetic diversity making populations more susceptible to diseases reducing adaptability to changing conditions and increasing the risk of local extinctions Challenge in Meeting Recovery Criteria The explicit detailing of recovery criteria including the required number of populations and subpopulations along with their sizes indicates the existing threats to achieving these goals The failure to meet these criteria points to ongoing challenges in establishing stable selfsustaining populations which are critical for the recovery and eventual delisting of the species Development and Mining Conflicts The species recovery priority number indicates a high degree of threat from development and mining underscoring the conflict between economic activities and conservation efforts These activities can lead to direct habitat loss degradation and water pollution among other impacts that threaten the dragonflys survival and recovery Data Gaps and

identified threats for the Delta Green Ground Beetle Elaphrus viridis can be summarized as follows Habitat Destruction and Modification Factor A The primary identified threat to the Delta Green Ground Beetle is the destruction modification or curtailment of its habitat especially due to urban development agriculture and invasive species The beetles habitat is largely restricted to vernal pools which are themselves threatened ecosystems Although some habitats are protected within preserves conservation easements and conservation banks theres still a significant portion of the beetles known occurrences on unprotected private lands including areas not surveyed and thus remain unprotected Degradation of Habitat by Invasive Plants Factor A The invasion of nonnative plants into the beetles habitat is a significant concern as these invasive species can change the character of vernal pools potentially making them unsuitable for the beetle Management plans that address grazing practices controlled burns and the application of herbicides to control invasive plants partially address this threat Lack of Comprehensive Management Plans Although management plans exist for certain areas consistent and comprehensive management across all known and potential habitats of the Delta Green Ground Beetle is necessary to ensure the preservation of its habitat and to facilitate population viability Insufficient Research and Data A major obstacle to the beetles conservation is the lack of detailed understanding of its life cycle habitat preferences and population dynamics There is a need for ongoing research into the biology and ecology of the beetle including mortality rates productivity dispersal mechanisms and preferred habitat conditions Lack of Coordinated Conservation Efforts The need for a recovery implementation team to oversee recovery actions and the formation of multiple working groups at the vernal pool region level indicates a requirement for more coordinated efforts in conservation actions outreach programs and stakeholder involvement Climate and Environmental Factors Although not explicitly mentioned as a primary threat the beetles reliance on vernal pool habitats suggests that changes in climate rainfall patterns and hydrology could impact its survival indirectly by affecting the vernal pool ecosystemsThese threats encompass several factors under the Endangered Species Act primarily Factor A destruction modification or curtailment of its habitat or range The Recovery Plan notes that while overutilization for commercial recreational scientific or educational purposes Factor B and other manmade or natural factors Factor E were not identified as threats in the listing rule they are considered due to information gained

identifying threats to Pseudanophthalmus holsingeri Holsingers cave beetle we can infer the general threats to cavedwelling beetles based on the overarching sections of the document that discuss threats and factors influencing viability While the document doesnt list specific threats in the provided excerpts it outlines a robust framework for identifying threats to cave beetles within the domain of cave ecosystems Heres a synthesized overview of identified threats based on the general approach to assessing the species status reported Habitat Loss or Degradation The significant emphasis on habitat specifics including the stable environmental conditions within caves and the unique geomorphology of the regions these beetles inhabit points to habitat loss or degradation as a primary threat This could be due to natural changes or anthropogenic activities Water Table Changes and Hydrological System Disruption The document highlights the importance of seasonal fluctuations in parameters like water levels which can introduce variability in food sources and reproduction cues for cave species Any alteration to the hydrological systems or changes in the water table due to external activities or climate change could pose significant threats Impacts from QuarryingMining and Commercial Cave Operations The text implies a potential threat from commercial activities that might alter the physical structure of caves Quarrying mining and commercial cave operations can significantly impact the structural integrity and environmental stability of caves Urbanization and Development Pressures Projected changes in impervious surfaces within conservation sites are mentioned as a metric for future threat projections The increase in impervious surfaces due to urbanization or development can lead to habitat fragmentation reduced permeability of the landscape for water infiltration and potentially disrupt the delicate ecological balance within cave systems Climate Change While not explicitly mentioned in the provided text the implications of changing environmental conditions outside the caves which could in turn affect the internal cave environment to some extent cannot be ignored Changes in temperature precipitation patterns and extreme weather events due to climate change could indirectly threaten these beetles by altering the conditions of their cave habitats or the surrounding areas crucial for their survival Stochastic Events Given the low redundancy and restricted geographic ranges of these beetles stochastic random events like floods droughts or disease outbreaks could disproportionately impact their populations Their limited dispersal capabilities and specialized habitat requirements make recovery from such events challenging Lack of Genetic Diversity Due to Isolated Populations Although not directly mentioned the assessments focus on the discrete analysis units and the low or no redundancy for most of the assessed species implies potential threats from inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity making them more vulnerable to environmental changes and diseasesThe threats to Pseudanophthalmus holsingeri can be reasonably inferred to be a combination of these factors given its ecology and requirements for survival are closely aligned with those of the other cave beetles within the same genus covered in the document Effective

hungerfordi also known as the Hungerfords Crawling Water Beetle based on the information provided are as follows Destruction or Modification of Habitat Activities that degrade water quality or alter the pools riffles and stream environment where the species lives can significantly impact its survival These activities may include logging stream dredging pollution and general stream degradation all potentially contributing to habitat reduction for Brychius hungerfordi Beaver Activity While beaver dams can create suitable habitat downstream they can also eliminate it upstream and cause significant siltation downstream The impact of beaver activity can vary it can be beneficial in creating habitat in some streams while detrimental in others by eliminating habitat features necessary for the beetle Culvert Replacement Projects Removing undersized culverts can improve water quality and habitat connectivity but can also pose risks if the replacement projects do not carefully consider the needs of Brychius hungerfordi If suitable habitat features are lost or if Dichotomosiphon colonies important for the beetle are removed it can take years for the habitat to become suitable again Overutilization for Scientific Purposes Macroinvertebrate monitoring and inadvertent collection can pose a threat if specimens are not examined carefully before collection and are instead preserved Outreach and education are needed to raise awareness about the beetles endangered status and to encourage survey crews to identify all Halipidae to species before collecting Disease or Predation The potential for increased predation or the introduction of disease especially with new nonnative aquatic species could pose significant threats through predation pressure or competition

documented in the text the identified threats to Drosophila tarphytrichia a picturewing fly endemic to Oahu Hawaii are multifaceted These threats include Habitat Modification and Loss    Invasion of nonnative plant species Species such as Psidium cattleianum strawberry guava Lantana camara lantana Melinis minutiflora molasses grass Schinus terebinthifolius Christmas berry and Clidemia hirta significantly degrade native forests and the host plants of picturewing flies by forming dense stands that outcompete native plants    Wildfire Altered fire regimes characterized by increased fire frequency facilitated by ungulate disturbance and the invasion of fireadapted alien plants notably Melinis minutiflora pose a significant threat to the dry and mesic lowland forests home to Drosophila tarphytrichia Native flora is not adapted to this increase in fire frequency    Feral ungulates The presence of pigs and goats facilitates the spread of nonnative plant species and directly alters native ecosystems through grazing and trampling which can lead to soil erosion and further habitat degradation Introduction of Nonnative Predators and Competitors    Nonnative insects Predation by nonnative insects such as ants puts substantial pressure on all life stages of Drosophila tarphytrichia Additionally competition for resources from nonnative tipulid flies crane flies which also feed within the decomposing bark of Charpentiera obovata threatens larval survival and development    Disease or Predation    While disease is not known to be a threat predation by nonnative insects and

Spelaeorchestia koloana also known as the Kauai Cave Amphipod according to the Year Review Summary and Evaluation detailed in the text can be grouped as follows Habitat Destruction and Modification    Development activities in the Koloa District of Kauai including construction of roads houses golf courses and quarrying operations pose significant threats by destroying or modifying cave and mesocavern habitats Such land uses destroy or fill subterranean habitats isolate populations and may lead to local extinction during periods of prolonged drought by confining populations to caves without climatic refugia    Urbanization results in reduced ground water recharge which may decrease humidity levels within caves degrading or eliminating habitat for these species    Human activities in caves including use as dumping and filling sites introduction of contaminants and changes caused by minings can destroy critical habitat including the food resources like root systems    Human Disturbance    Visitation and improper use of caves can crush or injure cavedwelling species and introduce nonnative species that compete with or prey on native cave fauna Activities such as leaving trash which can attract invasive arthropods and increase predator populations like centipedes and spiders pose significant threats    Nicotine from cigarette smoke open fires drying cave interiors and other toxic fumes from human activities can have devastating effects on cave environments and their inhabitants Predation and Competition from Nonnative Species    Nonnative predators such as the brown violin spider Loxosceles rufescens lesser brown scorpion Isometrus maculatus and webbuilding spiders are known or assumed to compete with or prey upon the Kauai Cave Amphipod These invaders introduce novel methods of predation and competition potentially leading to declines in native populations Pollution    Runoff containing urban and household pesticides could introduce high concentrations of toxins into cave habitats with potentially devastating impacts on native species    Pesticides household cleaners and other chemicals from septic tanks and leaching fields can contaminate cave environments Biocontrol Agents    Biological control agents used to manage pest populations may inadvertently affect nontarget species including cavedwelling organisms putting them at risk of decline or extinction Climate Change and Natural Disasters    Prolonged drought possibly exacerbated by global climate change or local alterations in vegetation may desiccate cave interiors making them inhospitable for endemic species and more prone to invasion by nonnative competitors and predators    Small populations are more vulnerable to extinction from demographic fluctuations and

more than  years suggesting they are currently selfsustaining populations Although not fully meeting the recovery plans geographical distribution criterion for downlisting we believe that the best available scientific and commercial data support the conclusion that the species has recovered to the point where it is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range but that it is likely to become so in the foreseeable future primarily because of the threat of climate change Comment Several commenters including nongovernmental organizations expressed concerns that the Services conclusion that the American burying beetle no longer meets the definition of endangered is not based on improved conditions for the species but rather on our acceptance of a diminished conservation status for the species They are concerned that changes in our understanding of the species range and the threats it faces particularly related to climate change warrant retaining its endangered statusOur Response In our determination we considered changes in the species range the conditions of its habitat the population size and the threats facing the species We determined that the American burying beetles status has improved to the point that it is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range However we recognize that the American burying beetle is still at risk of becoming endangered in the foreseeable future particularly due to projected climate changes Our findings are an outcome of an indepth review of the best available scientific and commercial data regarding the current status of the species and potential threats as analyzed under the Acts five listing factors While climate change poses a significant threat to the species especially in the southern portions of its range current conservation measures and regulatory mechanisms have reduced some threats and enhanced the conservation of the species Nonetheless we have determined that a threatened status is appropriate given the likely future impacts of climate change and other threats Comment Some commenters stated that the proposed reclassification may be premature due to the lack of substantial conservation efforts specifically tailored to address the primary identified threat of climate changeOur Response While current conservation efforts and regulatory mechanisms address several threats to the American burying beetle there is limited ability to mitigate the broadscale effects of climate change directly However our decision considers both current status and future projections concerning the species including the best available scientific predictions related to climate change Our analysis indicates that the species is expected to face increased risks in the future due to climate change particularly in the southern regions of its range The implementation of the d rule tailored conservation measures and ongoing management actions contribute to the conservation of the species and its habitat We will continue to monitor the status of the American burying beetle and the effectiveness of conservation measures and are committed to working with partners to implement and enhance conservation efforts including those that may help the species adapt to changing climate conditions Comment Multiple commenters raised concerns regarding the adequacy of regulatory mechanisms to protect the American burying beetle particularly in the face of climate changeOur Response Current regulatory mechanisms including the Endangered Species Act state wildlife protection laws and other local and federal regulations provide a level of protection to the American burying beetle and its habitat The d rule finalized with the downlisting provides tailored protections that are necessary and advisable to conserve the species While regulatory mechanisms by themselves may not be sufficient to offset all threats to the species especially broadscale threats such as climate change they do provide a framework for the implementation of conservation measures and habitat management efforts These efforts are

the specific threats to the San Bruno Elfin Butterfly Callophrys mossii bayensis are not directly listed in the excerpt you provided However based on the context and the typical concerns for butterfly species we can infer potential threats that are likely applicable to Callophrys mossii bayensis by analyzing the information about its biology habitat requirements and spatial distribution provided in the text The identified factors and inferred threats include Habitat Loss and Fragmentation The limited and fragmented distribution of Callophrys mossii bayensis primarily restricted to San Mateo County along with the butterflys dependency on specific host plants and habitats suggests that habitat loss and fragmentation are significant threats Urbanization and development leading to the loss of natural habitats are general threats to butterfly populations affecting this subspecies as well Climate Variation and Weather Conditions The text mentions that adult flight season and activities are highly susceptible to variable weather conditions implying that climate change and weather extremes such as prolonged rainy periods or droughts could pose threats by disrupting life cycle events such as mating egglaying and feeding Lack of Genetic Diversity Though not explicitly mentioned the small and isolated populations likely suffer from limited genetic diversity making them more vulnerable to diseases changing environmental conditions and reduced reproductive success Parasitism and Predation The associated risks of parasitism by Tachinid fly Aplomya theclarum and potentially other parasites or predators including possible threats from ant associations could impact larval and pupal survival rates Dependency on a Single Host Plant The elfins reliance on Sedum spathulifolium stonecrop as its larval host plant constrains its habitat range and makes it vulnerable to any threats that reduce the availability or health of this plant such as invasive species competition pesticide use or disease Human Disturbance Given the butterflys specific habitat preferences and the proximity of its habitats to urban areas recreational activities and other forms of human disturbance could disrupt its populations or degrade its habitat quality Natural Succession and Lack of Disturbance Regimes Succession in its coastal shrub and chaparral habitats without the occurrence of natural disturbances eg fire that renew host plant growth could gradually reduce suitable habitats for the elfin as mentioned regarding habitat characteristics and dynamicsConservation

habitat destruction through residential and commercial development Historical land use for grazing and agriculture as well as residential and urban development significantly reduced the butterflys range Modification of habitat through weed control practices and invasion by nonnative weeds are also threats to the butterflys habitat Lack of Regulatory Protection for Insects under Certain Laws The butterfly is not protected under the California Endangered Species Act CESA as this act does not cover insects While the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA and the Natural Communities Conservation Planning NCCP Act can provide some level of habitat consideration these measures are not specifically mandated to protect insects like the Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly Predation and Disease There is a concern about potential predation by earwigs on larval and egg stages of the butterfly during restoration efforts although this is not currently considered a significant threat The text does not indicate disease as a current major threat but acknowledges that neither disease nor predation is known to have substantial impacts at the time of review Insufficient Recovery Measures in Existing Habitat Current habitats require management to control the spread of nonnative weeds There is mention of successful weed management programs but also an indication that historically impacted habitat will need restoration and planting of host plants for future recovery efforts Potential Threats from Future Development Although measures have been taken to minimize the impact of development on known butterfly habitats there is an acknowledgment that new development proposals could pose a threat especially in areas not currently designated for conservation Limited Habitat Availability for Reintroduction Efforts While there are large tracts of undeveloped land within the historical distribution of the butterfly that could potentially support its reintroduction following habitat restoration the availability and suitability of these lands are contingent upon conservation efforts and plans that may or may not fully materialize Limited Dispersal Ability of Adults Initial studies suggest that the butterflys adults especially females may be relatively poor dispersers which could impact the butterflys ability to recolonize areas and maintain genetic diversity across patches of suitable habitatThe ongoing conservation efforts such as the captive breeding program and habitat restoration are vital steps toward mitigating these threats Furthermore the development of

provided the identified threats to Apodemia mormo langei Langes metalmark butterfly are primarily related to the loss and degradation of their habitat within and around the Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge Major contributing factors to this threat include Industrial Activities and Urbanization The Antioch Dunes NWR is surrounded by industrial activities and urban development which have historically degraded the dune habitat essential for the survival of Langes metalmark butterfly This includes pollution from nearby industrial activities and disturbance from recreational use and trespassing Invasive Nonnative Plant Species The invasion of nonnative plants has significantly altered the dune ecosystem competing with native plants for resources and altering the habitat This poses a significant threat to the butterflys survival since its host plant the nakedstemmed buckwheat Eriogonum nudum var auriculum is affected by these changes Limited Habitat The butterfly is endemic to the Antioch Dunes a very small and geographically isolated area The restriction of its habitat to this small area makes the species especially vulnerable to extinction due to habitat destruction alteration and fragmentation Sand Mining and Habitat Disturbance Past sand mining has significantly disturbed the dune habitat Although the refuge was established to protect the remaining habitat historical disturbances have likely contributed to the decline in butterfly population Limited Genetic Diversity The populations isolation and small size may lead to limited genetic diversity making the species more susceptible to diseases and reducing its ability to adapt to environmental changes Climate Change and Environmental Stochasticity As an additional inferred threat climate change could further impact the butterflys habitat by altering precipitation patterns and temperature which in turn could affect the phenology and availability of its host and nectar plantsWhile the text does not explicitly list climate change as a current threat it is a relevant consideration for longterm conservation planning for any endangered species with highly restricted habitatsThe identified threats primarily relate to Listing Factor A the present or threatened destruction modification or curtailment of its habitat or range of the Endangered Species Act Additionally the impacts of invasive species potential for disease and predation due to small population sizes and possible inadequacies in existing regulatory mechanisms to fully protect the species and its habitat Factors A

reliance on specific habitat conditions for survival The developments and land use changes including agricultural conversion residential development pesticide use and unauthorized activities such as sheep trailing and offroad vehicle use have negatively impacted the availability and quality of suitable habitats for the moth Private land ownerships in critical areas like Walker Basin Carrizo Plain and Cuyama Valley further complicate habitat protection efforts Inadequate Existing Regulatory Mechanisms Factor D The inability to enforce protection measures on private lands where a significant portion of the moths populations is found presents a challenge to its conservation Though the review mentions enforcement of applicable State and Federal laws as part of the recovery criteria theres an implication that current regulatory mechanisms might not be sufficiently protecting the moths habitat from degradation or modification Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence Factor E Various activities such as agricultural disking modification of washes offroad vehicle use road maintenance and sheep bedding are reported as adverse land practices These practices directly affect both the moth populations and their viable habitats Extended diapause as a survival strategy during drought conditions is mentioned indicating that climatic factors pose potential challenges to

pecos based on the text can be summarized as follows Reduction of Water in Springs The most critical threat comes from the loss or alteration of spring habitat crucial for the survival of Assiminea pecos The lowering of water tables due to groundwater withdrawals for irrigation and municipal use has historically degraded their habitats Aquifer depletion has previously caused some historical sites to dry up This threat includes the potential failure of spring flow due to excessive groundwater pumping or drought leading to total habitat loss for the species Water Contamination Contamination from oil and gas operations poses a significant risk to Assiminea pecos The springs that Assiminea pecos and other invertebrates rely on could be threatened by pollutants from the wide array of active wells and petroleum products near their habitats Spills or leaks from these sources could lead to contamination that would be challenging to remediate effectively due to the difficulty and expense of purifying an aquifer Fire Fire suppression difficulties and the aftermath of wildfires pose a potential threat to Assiminea pecos Fires could lead to habitat alterations that unfavorably affect the snails Removal of vegetation cover by burning could make the habitat unsuitable due to insufficient litter and ground cover which are necessary for maintaining soil moisture and humidity Moreover fires could result in increased sedimentation and changes in the flow patterns that impact the microhabitats of these species Impact from Invasive Species While not mentioned directly for Assiminea pecos wildfires and other disturbances often lead to the proliferation of invasive plant species like Phragmites australis which can alter habitats in ways that could be detrimental to native species including potentially Assiminea pecos by changing the wetland and spring ecosystems they rely on Oil and Gas Development The active and potential development of oil and gas extraction fields including drilling and the operational risks associated with pipelines and refineries pose an ongoing threat Infrastructure failures or operational mishaps could lead to direct contamination of the unique spring systems supporting Assiminea pecos The presence of active wells and pipelines close to their habitats raises the risk of pollution from petroleum products Climate Change and Drought Though not explicitly mentioned the threats of reduced spring flows aquifer depletion and exacerbated drought conditions likely reflect broader impacts of climate change These could amplify other stresses on Assiminea pecos populations by altering regional water cycles and availabilityIn conclusion Assiminea pecos faces several significant threats mainly related to water

Pyrgulopsis bruneauensis Bruneau hot springsnail from the provided text are as follows Primary Threat Groundwater Withdrawal and Springflow Reduction The most significant threat to the species continues to be springflow reduction due to groundwater withdrawal This threat has resulted in the ongoing decline of the geothermal habitat required by the Bruneau hot springsnail Despite the existence of a groundwater management plan developed for the Grand ViewBruneau Groundwater Management Area the specifics of groundwater withdrawal rates and their direct impact on the species habitat suggest that current management and regulations have not succeeded in reversing the decline of the geothermal aquifer Secondary Threat Predation from Nonnative Fishes Predation by introduced fish species remains a concern for the Bruneau hot springsnail Although the text does not elaborate extensively on the impact it mentions predation as a secondary threat implying that nonnative fish may contribute to the species endangerment by preying on the snails LowLevel Threats Livestock Grazing Identified as a lowranking threat in both  and subsequent reviews livestock grazing continues to impact the species but is not considered a primary cause of its endangerment Surface Water Diversion Like livestock grazing surface water diversion is viewed as a lowranking threat Specific to the downstream portion of the snails range it poses a potential concern without being critical Recreation Recreational activities in the habitat area of the Bruneau hot springsnail are also categorized as a lowlevel threat Its impact remains consistent with previous assessments indicating that while present recreational pressures do not critically endanger the species Other Considered or Previously Identified Threats Overcollection Not regarded as a concern since the  review indicating that previously overcollection might have been considered a potential threat but has since been determined not to significantly impact the species survival Flash Flood Sedimentation No longer considered a threat suggesting that past considerations of habitat damage from sedimentation due to flash flooding have been reassessed and found to be of minimal concern New or Potential Threats Invasive Species Hydrilla The invasive aquatic plant Hydrilla could restrict water flow degrade water quality and outcompete native species potentially affecting the Bruneau hot springsnail However aggressive eradication programs have largely controlled its spread within the Bruneau River and its not currently considered an active threat to the snail The need for ongoing monitoring and control is emphasized  Regulatory Inadequacy Inadequate State Regulations Despite some efforts current state regulations are not adequate to address the primary threat of groundwater withdrawal highlighting a significant area for improvement in conservation managementIn summary the primary ongoing threat to Pyrgulopsis bruneauensis is the reduction of springflow due to groundwater withdrawal with secondary and lowerlevel threats including predation by nonnative fishes livestock grazing surface water diversion recreation and

provided the following are identified threats to Pyrgulopsis bruneauensis also known as the Bruneau Hot Springsnail Groundwater and Habitat Management The first criterion for consideration of reclassification from endangered to threatened has not been met due to insufficient groundwater and habitat management activities Although a Groundwater Management Area for the Grand ViewBruneau area was designated in  the geothermal habitat critical to the snail continues to decline Additionally a comprehensive management plan for this area has not been developed indicating a threat to the snails habitat from inadequate management practices Declining Water Levels in Geothermal Aquifer The geothermal water levels measured show a declining trend which indicates a direct threat to the snails habitat Specifically water levels in the geothermal aquifer display a decreasing trend with measurements indicating that the levels are lower than those reported in previous years This decrease leads to a loss in the number of geothermal springs which are essential for the snails survival Reduction in Number of Geothermal Springs There has been a significant reduction in the total number of geothermal springs detected with many previously detected springs drying up Since the snail is dependent on these springs for survival their reduction or loss poses a significant threat to the species conservation Occupancy and Density Declines Only a small percentage of the remaining springs are occupied by the snails and there has been a notable decline in colony densities The decline in occupied springs and in the density of snail populations within these springs indicates ongoing habitat degradation and fragmentation further threatening the species survival Regulatory Measures and Protection The review notes that regulatory mechanisms are inadequate or have not been implemented effectively to protect the geothermal aquifer system from further reductions This lack of protective measures threatens the groundwater levels critical to the snails habitat contributing to the overall threat to the species Genetic Diversity and Isolation While not directly identified as a threat in the text the mention of the species being genetically diverse but consisting of two distinct groups that are not associated with a specific geographic area implies a concern regarding potential genetic isolation or fragmentation Further studies were recommended to investigate genetic structure gene flow and dispersal which could have implications for the species longterm viability and resilience

essential for the species survival and include Spring Modifications  Past and present disturbances to spring habitats including physical alterations and modifications affecting water flow and quality These modifications result from human activities such as impoundments channel diversions and constructions that alter the natural state of the springs Competition and Predation  Pressures from both invasive and native species that compete with or prey upon Pyrgulopsis carinifera Introduced aquatic species can significantly stress the populations by altering the food web or directly preying upon them Water Pollution  Contamination from agricultural runoffs urban development and other sources can degrade water quality affecting the suitability of habitats for Pyrgulopsis carinifera Groundwater Pumping and Withdrawals  The extraction of groundwater for agricultural urban or industrial use can lower the water table affecting spring flows Reductions in groundwater discharge due to pumping can result in diminished spring flow impacting the amount of available habitat water quality and temperature all critical for Pyrgulopsis carinifera Climate Change Effects  Projected increases in temperature and alterations in precipitation patterns could exacerbate the stress on spring habitats by potentially reducing water availability and altering habitat conditions Increased temperatures and variable precipitation could further affect groundwater recharge rates and thus spring discharge on which Pyrgulopsis carinifera depends Uncertainties Associated with Proposed Groundwater

isolated springs along its banks This limited distribution makes the species particularly vulnerable to changes in its habitat such as alterations in water quality or quantity The snails preference for certain temperature and water quality parameters underscores its specialized habitat needs These narrow habitat requirements can make the species more susceptible to habitat degradation or loss Water Quality Concerns The review highlights concerns about water temperature exceedances and emerging contaminants like nitrates in the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer ESPA potentially affecting the snails habitat Water quality issues particularly the increases in water temperatures and nitrate concentrations pose considerable threats to the species The exceedance of state water quality standards for coldwater biota and the presence of nitrates could negatively impact the snails growth reproduction and survival rates Environmental Factors Influencing Population Fluctuations External environmental factors such as river flows and potentially flooding can greatly influence the snail populations While some populations may rebound if disturbed habitats are returned to predisturbance conditions within certain timeframes not all populations may display such resilience Moreover certain areas within the species range may exhibit only very low densities or none at all highlighting the potential for environmental conditions to unevenly affect populations across the snails range Vulnerability of Small Isolated Populations The extirpation of an upstream springdwelling population since

provided several threats to the conservation of the Conservancy Fairy Shrimp Branchinecta conservatio can be identified These threats include Habitat Loss and Fragmentation The habitat of Conservancy Fairy Shrimp primarily large and turbid vernal pools is restricted to specific regions in California Development pressures agricultural expansion and changes in land use significantly threaten these habitats by reducing available space fragmenting remaining habitats and potentially altering the hydrology of vernal pools necessary for the shrimps lifecycle  Management Practices Mismanagement or changes in land management practices such as those suggested at Mapes Ranch in Stanislaus County where changes in the management of vernal pools may have altered hydrology pose a risk to the suitable habitats of the Conservancy Fairy Shrimp Effective management is crucial for maintaining the ecosystems that support these species Protection of Habitat Lack of adequate protection for key habitats is a critical threat Although some populations are located within protected areas or conservation banks others are on private land without conservation easements or specific protections in place This situation leaves vulnerable populations exposed to potential development or adverse land management practices that could destroy or degrade their habitats Climate Change While not explicitly mentioned in the text provided climate change is a looming threat to many species including the Conservancy Fairy Shrimp Changes in precipitation patterns increased occurrence of extreme weather events and alterations in seasonal cycles can impact the ephemeral vernal pools these shrimp rely on for their lifecycle potentially leading to population declines or localized extinctions Limited Geographic Range and Population Isolation The species is endemic to specific regions in California with some widely separated populations The isolation of these populations could result in genetic bottlenecks reduced genetic diversity and increased vulnerability to stochastic events or disease outbreaks This isolation also makes recolonization of habitats once lost very difficult Inadequate Research and Monitoring There is an implied need for ongoing research and monitoring to better understand the species distribution population trends and conservation requirements Lack of information can hinder effective conservation efforts and could lead to prioritization of other areas or species with more available dataIn summary the primary threats to the Conservancy Fairy Shrimp include habitat loss

Longhorn Fairy Shrimp Branchinecta longiantenna are largely centered around habitat loss and degradation mainly due to agriculture conversion urbanization and potential mismanagement of public lands Heres a summary based on the extensive review information provided Habitat Destruction and Modification Factor A This is identified as a significant threat particularly from agricultural conversion and urban development which impacts the fragile vernal pool ecosystems required by the Longhorn Fairy Shrimp Although a significant portion of known populations is protected on public lands which mitigates this threat to some extent ongoing concerns about habitat loss outside these protected areas remain Inefficacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms Factor D While some regulations exist to protect this species and its habitat including the designation of critical habitat and protection under the Endangered Species Act the adequacy of these measures in the face of ongoing and potential future threats is a concern The success of regulatory mechanisms relies on their proper implementation and enforcement areas where challenges persist Inadequate Habitat Protection and Management Although substantial efforts have been made to protect habitat within identified core recovery areas there is an acknowledged need for more protections especially in terms of habitat management and monitoring plans The recovery plan calls for a significant portion of suitable habitat to be protected and for populations to be protected across their geographic and genetic ranges but acknowledges that these goals have not yet been fully achieved Lack of Comprehensive Habitat and Species Monitoring There is a noted lack of a consistent comprehensive program for monitoring the hydrology essential for vernal pool ecosystem function and the status of the Longhorn Fairy Shrimp populations This gap hinders the ability to assess the effectiveness of habitat protection and management efforts and to understand the species status fully Threats from Environmental Disturbances Threats such as increased risk of extirpation from stochastic events including severe droughts degradation of habitat by invasive plant species inappropriate grazing practices and other unforeseen environmental disturbances are noted These threats can impact isolated populations even within protected areas and undermine conservation efforts Need for Adaptive Habitat Management The need for effective habitat management and monitoring plans that can adapt to changing conditions and ensure the maintenance of ecosystem function and species viability is highlighted as a critical area for ongoing and future focus Research Gaps There is an acknowledgment of essential unanswered research questions that need to be addressed to inform recovery efforts effectively This includes research into the species biology habitat requirements genetic diversity and responses to environmental changesIn summary the

conservation actions Status Quo Scenario This scenario assumes current levels of urbanization agricultural land use climate conditions and water withdrawal continue into the future without significant change or additional conservation actions In this scenario the threats affecting the Brawleys Fork crayfish and its habitat are expected to persist at current levels The cumulative impacts of these threats may result in a gradual decline in the resiliency of some AUs due to ongoing habitat degradation and fragmentation However some populations may maintain their current condition if the impact of these threats remains stable Redundancy and representation might slightly decrease as a result of habitat degradation and potential loss of some isolated populations Increased Urbanization Scenario This scenario projects increased urbanization within the Brawleys Fork crayfish range leading to higher rates of sedimentation pollution and altered hydrology The expansion of urban areas is expected to increase impervious surfaces resulting in higher runoff volumes that carry pollutants and sediments into streams further degrading crayfish habitat Increased urbanization is also likely to exacerbate the effects of climate change including altered precipitation patterns and increased water temperatures Under this scenario the resiliency of most if not all AUs is expected to decline due to significant habitat loss and degradation Additionally redundancy and representation could be severely impacted as urbanization fragments and isolates populations potentially leading to local extirpations Increased Conservation Actions Scenario This optimistic scenario assumes the implementation of targeted conservation actions to mitigate the threats affecting the Brawleys Fork crayfish such as habitat restoration implementation of best management practices in agriculture improved urban planning to minimize runoff and strategies to conserve water Under this scenario the resiliency of Brawleys Fork crayfish populations is expected to improve over time as habitat conditions are restored or enhanced Conservation actions could also increase redundancy by supporting the connectivity among populations and enhance representation by preserving genetic diversity and allowing for adaptation to changing environmental conditionsEach scenario considers the interacting effects of multiple threats and the capacity of Brawleys Fork crayfish populations to adapt to changing conditions The precise outcomes for each scenario will depend on the extent and effectiveness of conservation

mold beetle and other listed karst invertebrates in Bexar County TX are not directly specified in the text provided However the text discusses the designation of critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act ESA for these species which implies that threats exist from habitat destruction degradation and fragmentation due to urban development landuse changes and possibly other factors related to human activities It does mention threats to karst habitats such as destruction from development and the presence of invasive species like the red imported fire ant which could impact native species by altering the ecological balanceIssues discussed that imply threats to Batrisodes venyivi and the other invertebrates include Habitat Designation and Protection The effort to designate critical habitat for nine Bexar County invertebrates including Batrisodes venyivi indicates these species are at risk due to habitatspecific threats that warrant federal protection under the ESA The designation of critical habitat involves identifying areas that contain physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species suggesting threats from habitat loss alteration or fragmentation    Karst Habitat Specificity The document references karst habitats which are unique geological features that support specialized fauna The threats to these environments such as development leading to habitat destruction and fragmentation pollution and changes in hydrology can impact the subterranean and surface habitats essential for the survival of karstdwelling invertebrates Need for Special Management and Protection The mention of areas requiring further research or conservation efforts and the discussion on the need for special management considerations or protection allude to threats from human activities that could impact habitat quality and the survival of these species Environmental Changes Although the text does not explicitly detail environmental changes as threats the efforts to establish critical habitat imply an underlying threat from changes that could alter the delicate ecological balance of karst habitats such as climate change increased drying or changes in vegetation that affect the soil and water quality vital to cave systems Genetic Isolation The discussion on the potential for genetic isolation due to the segregation of cave systems suggests a threat to the genetic diversity and longterm viability of these karst invertebrates potentially making them more susceptible to disease environmental changes and other stressors To fully understand specific

reddelli based on the provided text are not explicitly listed in a single concise section However by synthesizing the information regarding general threats to karst invertebrates in Travis and Williamson Counties Texas we can infer several key threats impacting these species including Texamaurops reddelli Habitat Destruction and Disturbance The recovery plan emphasizes the protection of karst fauna areas from threats like habitat destruction This suggests ongoing or potential threats from urban development landuse changes and other anthropogenic activities that can lead to the loss or degradation of the caves and karst systems these species inhabit Contamination The plan highlights the need for karst areas to be protected from contaminants This points to a threat from pollutants entering the karst system which could include agricultural runoff pesticides wastewater or other forms of pollution that degrade water quality in these subterranean habitats Invasive Species The recovery plan mentions protection from threats such as fire ants which are nonnative species This indicates that invasive species pose a threat to the native karst invertebrates by potentially outcompeting them for resources altering habitat structure or directly preying upon them Hydrological Changes Given the importance of stable hydrological conditions for karst invertebrates alterations to the natural flow of water within the karst system  due to water extraction changes in land use or other factors  could threaten these species by affecting the availability of water nutrients and conditions necessary for their survival Climate Change Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided text sections climate change is a pervasive threat that can exacerbate all the above threats and directly impact the stable environmental conditions crucial for karst invertebrates Changes in temperature precipitation patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events could disrupt the delicate balance of cave ecosystems Limited Distribution and Small Population Size The fact that recovery efforts focus on the protection of specific karst fauna areas indicates that these species including Texamaurops reddelli likely have limited distributions and small population sizes making them more vulnerable to extinction from sudden environmental changes or catastrophic eventsIts important to note that the specific sections of text provided predominantly focus on recovery plans and considerations for listed karst invertebrates broadly rather than detailing threats exclusively

enumeration of these threats according to the five factors described in section a of the Endangered Species Act is not explicitly stated in the extracted text Nonetheless based on the information provided and common threats to endangered species the following are likely key threats to Cicindela ohlone Habitat Loss and Fragmentation The fragmentation and loss of native grassland habitats due to urban development agriculture and other land uses are likely major threats The beetle is endemic to Santa Cruz County California and relies on coastal terraces that support native grassland habitats The specifics regarding habitat alterations are crucial for example changes in land use that eliminate bare open areas necessary for larval burrows thermoregulation and foraging could drastically affect the beetles populations The documentation of occurrences being potentially extirpated in certain areas hints at significant habitat pressures Soil Disturbance and Alteration The Ohlone tiger beetles reliance on specific soil types Watsonville loam or Bonnydoon soil types that are characterized by certain drainage texture and crust formation properties suggest that any alteration in soil chemistry structure or hydrology could pose threats Activities that lead to soil compaction changes in soil moisture regimes contamination or erosion could directly impact the suitability of these habitats for the beetles life cycle stages Climate Change While not directly stated the impact of climate change could be inferred as a potential longterm threat affecting the beetles habitat quality and availability Changes in precipitation patterns and temperature regimes could affect soil moisture and structure plant community composition and the availability of prey species Given the beetles narrowly defined habitat requirements for thermoregulation and foraging climate change could exacerbate existing pressures Human Disturbance and Recreational Pressure The beetles habitats are often found along trails or barren areas that are attractive for recreational activities Increased human presence trampling and recreational uses of these habitats could lead to direct disturbance to the beetles and their larvae as well as alterations in habitat structure and function Invasive Species While not explicitly mentioned the introduction and spread of invasive plant species could alter the ecological dynamics of the native grassland habitats where Cicindela ohlone resides Invasive plants may alter the physical and biological structure of the habitats potentially reducing the quality or availability of necessary bare ground for larval burrows and adult foragingThe synthesis of information to evaluate the status of Cicindela ohlone and the threats it faces likely considers a combination of these factors as part of the fivefactor analysis used to assess the current state of endangered species Conservation actions recommended typically aim to mitigate these threats by

Status Assessment Report for the Great Sand Dunes Tiger Beetle Cicindela theatina identifies several factors that influence whether the species will be able to maintain large and stable subpopulations which are crucial for its resilience to stochastic events and ultimately its survival These factors collectively point towards the habitats stability and quality as key determinants of the beetles future viability The identified threats include Stable Dunes The need for relatively stable dunes maintained by a complex combination of hydrologic and wind conditions Any alteration in these conditions that destabilizes the dunes can pose a significant threat to the species Undisturbed Dunes The necessity for relatively undisturbed dunes forms a crucial part of their habitat requirements Disturbances could reduce the suitability of their habitat Suitable Vegetation Cover The availability of suitable vegetation cover on the dunes ranging from  to  percent cover is essential for the beetles lifecycle Deviations from these vegetation cover levels due to changes in environmental conditions or human activities could affect the beetle adversely Connectivity between SubPopulations Connectivity between the subpopulations across its range is vital for maintaining genetic diversity and ensuring resilience Fragmentation of habitat or barriers that impede movement could threaten the populations viability Loss of Dune Habitats The most significant potential threat identified is the future loss of dune habitats necessary for their life history Any activities or environmental changes leading to the loss of critical dune habitat would be detrimental Surface Disturbances Surface disturbances within areas of suitable habitat can result in the loss of dune habitat and potentially cause injury or mortality of individuals Although historical and current surface disturbances in areas of suitable habitat are estimated to be low less than  percent of the suitable habitat any increase in disturbances could pose a considerable threat Climate Change and Its Implications The report also highlights the uncertainty regarding future effects of climate change including the potential for warmer temperatures and either increased or decreased precipitation However the overall trend expected is increased aridity due to warming temperatures Changes in climate that affect the hydrology and vegetation of dune habitats could adversely affect the GRSD tiger beetles ability to maintain viable populations Potential Future Ground Disturbances The assessment forecasts future scenarios concerning the beetles resilience redundancy and representation under various plausible future conditions including climate scenarios Uncertainty about future ground disturbances within the dunes poses a significant concern for the beetles future viabilityThese identified threats are based on current conditions and plausible future scenarios evaluated in the report Notably if the conditions that maintain suitable dune habitats and low levels of surface disturbance continue to be maintained the report anticipates that the GRSD tiger beetle could continue to persist into the future However the identified threats underscore the fragility of the beetles habitat and the importance of continued conservation efforts to mitigate these potential impacts,True,,identified threat cicindela sand dune tiger specie status assessment report sand dune tiger beetle cicindela identifies several factor influence whether specie maintain large stable

include Habitat Destruction and Degradation This encompasses the complete removal of native prairie habitat and its replacement with rowcrop agriculture It also includes habitat degradation due to recurring intensive livestock grazing and invasion by nonnative plant species Unsustainable Mortality from Management Practices This includes mortality caused by prescribed fires and insecticide use which is suggested as unsustainable for the species Fragmentation of Populations Historically Dakota skipper populations were more continuous but are now fragmented among discrete remnants of native tall grass and mixedgrass prairie This fragmentation is primarily due to habitat loss and plays a significant role in the species decline by isolating populations and decreasing genetic diversity and resilience Climate Change Although the SSA indicates that the current and future vulnerability of Dakota skipper populations to climate change was not fully assessed within the document it mentions the potential threat of novel environmental changes such as shifts to wetter and warmer conditions across the species range These conditions could increase the threat posed by invasive coolseason grasses Decrease in Resiliency Redundancy and Representation The document outlines how the number health and distribution of Dakota skipper populations have and are expected to continue declining thus reducing the species ability to withstand normal environmental variation catastrophes and adapt to new changes such as diseases and climate change Reduction in Adaptive Genetic Diversity The decrease in population sizes and the extirpation of populations from parts of its range reduces the species overall genetic diversity This reduction in genetic diversity diminishes the species potential for adaptation to environmental changes or novel threats Prescribed Management Practices Specific management practices such as burning haying and grazing regimes along with pesticide use were identified as influential factors on the viability of Dakota skipper populations These practices can negatively impact the quality of habitat and the survivability of populations if not applied in a manner that considers the needs of the Dakota skipper Loss of Populations and Metapopulation Dynamics Significant portions of metapopulations with metapopulation dynamics being crucial for species survival have

provided in the text the identified threats to Pyrgus ruralis lagunae Laguna Mountains skipper can be summarized as follows Habitat Destruction and Degradation    Grazing and trampling by cattle are significant threats that cause direct mortality of larvae and eggs and affect the primary host plant Horkelia clevelandii These activities also lead to habitat degradation through changes in hydrology invasion of exotic species and forest encroachment    The decline and restricted range of H clevelandii the primary host plant contribute significantly to the skippers vulnerability    Habitat fragmentation from private and public land use including roads highdensity cattle grazing and increased human recreation affects skipper populations Population Decline and Limited Distribution    The population of the Laguna Mountains skipper is decreasing with the subspecies having an extremely restricted and fragmented distribution Significant decline in presence and abundance throughout its range was noted since listing as endangered    Systematic population status studies are lacking with little current sighting data Historic locations in the Laguna Mountains no longer support visible populations and recent sightings are limited to the Palomar Mountain area    The subspecies is likely incapable of dispersal over large distances of unsuitable habitat that separate known occupied areas isolating populations Climatic and Environmental Vulnerabilities    Naturally occurring events such as weather extremes wildfires and fire exclusion policies droughts and changes in storm patterns could negatively impact the skippers habitat and survival rates Such events could affect egg larva and adult stages through changes in habitat and microclimate Potential Overgrazing    Grazing by cattle if not managed properly impacts the skipper directly through trampling and consumption of host plants and indirectly through habitat modification While grazing could potentially benefit the subspecies by maintaining open habitat excessive or poorly managed grazing exacerbates the threats to its survival Lack of Comprehensive Recovery Planning and Data    As of the date of the review no finalized recovery plan exists for P r lagunae recovery criteria are not established Insufficient empirical evidence and a lack of detailed systematic surveys hinder effective conservation efforts    Critical habitat has been proposed but not finalized which delays targeted habitat protection and restoration efforts Genetic Concerns    No information was available regarding genetic variation or inbreeding which are crucial for understanding the resilience and adaptability of the subspeciesIn summary the primary threats to Pyrgus ruralis lagunae include habitat degradation from

Megalagrion xanthomelas known as the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly based on the provided text include the following Habitat Loss and Degradation The specific environmental requirements of M xanthomelas such as clean slowtononflowing waters for breeding and specific salinity tolerances able to tolerate concentrations of at least  parts per thousand ppt and possibly as high as  ppt suggest that changes or reductions in suitable habitats could pose significant threats The indication that M xanthomelas breeds in anchialine pools which are unique coastal features and the mention of breeding in areas adjacent to native fish habitats that are being restored highlight habitatrelated vulnerabilities Additionally changes in habitat due to human activity or invasive species could limit their suitable breeding and feeding grounds Invasive Species The text implies a threat from introduced fish species and possibly other invasive animals that could either predate on M xanthomelas or compete for breeding sites The presence and tolerance of invasive species such as carp and Gambusia in certain pools suggest a direct competition for the same habitat necessary for the survival of the damselfly Environmental Changes Fluctuations in environmental conditions such as salinity levels in their habitat could impact M xanthomelas populations The fact that these damselflies have a certain tolerance to salinity but may be seen avoiding areas with high human impact suggests that water quality and environmental conditions directly affect their distribution and health Climatic

identified threats for Speyeria zerene behrensii Behrens silverspot butterfly can be summarized as follows Low Population Indices Population indices for Behrens silverspot butterfly have remained low throughout the survey years indicating consistently small population sizes There were years with zero butterflies recorded although this could be attributed to various factors like limited surveyor availability unpredictable coastal weather conditions and inherently low butterfly densities Possible Phenological Changes There is a suggestion of potential changes in the phenology biological timing of the butterfly as indicated by elongated flight periods observed in recent years compared to previous ones This implies that climate change or other environmental shifts could be affecting its lifecycle a factor that could pose a threat to its survival if it leads to desynchronization with the lifecycle of necessary resources like host plants Potential Unknown Populations The possibility of unknown Behrens silverspot butterfly populations suggests that the butterflys current distribution and population dynamics might not be fully understood This lack of comprehensive knowledge on its occurrences poses a threat to the butterfly as unknown populations could be subject to threats that are not currently being managed or mitigated Vulnerability of Small Populations to Stochastic Events Small populations like those of the Behrens silverspot butterfly are particularly vulnerable to stochastic events random or unpredictable events that can have negative effects on populations Such events could significantly decrease population viability and increase the risk of extinction Genetic Diversity and Structure No work on the genetics of the Behrens silverspot has been completed Understanding the genetic structure is critical for identifying metapopulation dynamics and ensuring genetic diversity which is essential for the longterm survival and adaptability of the species Habitat Requirements and Management The reliance on specific habitats including grazed lands that benefit host plant growth underscores the importance of habitat management for the butterflys lifecycle Mismanagement or changes in these habitats could pose a direct threat to its survival Captive Rearing and Augmentation Needs The document suggests the establishment of a captive rearing program as a potential action to bolster existing populations and prevent extinction This indicates that the species is facing survival challenges in the wild and requires human intervention for its persistence Range Extension and Habitat Suitability Concerns The reference to a specimen from a location that would represent a significant range extension in a different habitat type highlights the

threats and challenges to the recovery and conservation of the Mitchells Satyr Butterfly Neonympha mitchellii mitchellii a species of concern Here is a synthesis of the key threats identified in the document Habitat Loss and Degradation The species habitat primarily fens and wetlands has been diminishing and degrading due to several factors including agricultural expansion development and invasive species Habitat conservation plans and efforts such as restoration initiatives and management plans for several sites in Michigan and Indiana aim to address these threats by maintaining restoring and enhancing habitats Hydrological Changes The condition and hydrology of the fens where the butterflies live are critical Efforts to control invasive species that alter the habitats hydrology and to maintain fen hydrology are crucial to ensuring suitable habitats for the butterflies Climate Change The document hints at the need to find suitable habitats in the northern extent of the historic range of Mitchells Satyr as a potential recovery strategy in the face of a changing climate suggesting that climate change could impact the species survival and necessitate the exploration of new habitats for introductions or reintroductions Genetic and Disease Threats The mention of investigations into Wolbachia a bacterium that affects arthropod species indicates concerns about genetic health and diseases that can impact the populations Efforts related to captive breeding and rearing are geared towards maintaining genetic diversity and the health of the populations being reintroduced to the wild Invasive Species Control of nonnative invasive plant species like reed canary grass and hybrid cattails is part of habitat management efforts indicating the threat these species pose to maintaining suitable habitats for Mitchells Satyr Need for Updated Recovery Criteria The document notes that the recovery criteria in the existing plan do not reflect the most uptodate information since populations in Alabama Mississippi and Virginia were discovered after the completion of the Recovery Plan This raises concerns about whether existing or new threats are adequately addressed based on the latest information Challenges in Reintroduction Efforts Despite efforts to reintroduce the species to new or historic habitats including the use of captive reared butterflies there have been challenges such as low survival rates in reintroduction attempts and difficulties in capturing sufficient numbers of wild females for captive breeding programs These challenges

Neonympha mitchellii francisci Saint Francis satyr include Habitat Loss and Fragmentation This species is predisposed to local extinction due to its small population size and dependence on habitats subjected to regular disturbance events Without such disturbances the habitats become unsuitable leading to potential local extinctions Limited Population Size and Dispersal Ability The Saint Francis satyr has a limited ability to disperse making it even more vulnerable due to its already small population size This limited dispersal ability reduces the species capacity to recolonize areas or expand into new habitats that become suitable through natural processes or habitat management activities Dependence on Disturbance Events The species habitats are maintained through disturbances such as fire andor flooding Understanding the specific types of disturbance eg fire and flooding their intensity frequency and their intervals is crucial for predicting population persistence and distribution patterns across the landscape Limited Active Sites and Fluctuating Populations Most active sites of the Saint Francis satyr are found in areas with unexploded ordnance that are restricted in access complicating protection management and research efforts aimed at furthering understanding of this species Additionally the fluctuating populations and limited active sites outside of these impact areas result in uncertainty and insufficient data for assessing downlisting criteria Restricted Access and Safety Issues The butterflys populations within livefire and dud unexploded ordnance impact areas are challenging to study due to restricted access and potential safety hazards This limits the ability to monitor these populations regularly critically needed for understanding

previously known as Lampsilis subangulata or the shiny rayed pocketbook are Habitat Alteration and Loss This includes a wide array of land use activities that have altered or destroyed the natural habitats where H subangulata thrives Specific activities mentioned include water withdrawal dams channelization gravel mining pollution sedimentation and deadhead logging Climate Change While the exact impact of climate change on H subangulata is uncertain within its range it is considered a threat to the species viability The potential for climate change to exacerbate existing threats or introduce new challenges is recognized Fragmentation of Habitats The division of habitats into subbasins and the mention of relatively unfragmented habitat highlights the issue of habitat fragmentation It could impact the distribution and interconnectivity of populations affecting their genetic diversity and resilience Lack of Recruitment and Reduced Number of Individuals The difficulty in finding populations with evidence of recruitment young mussels successfully joining the population and the overall low numbers of individuals in many areas indicate a threat to the species ability to sustain its populations longterm Limited Distribution and Population Decline Though not stated explicitly as a threat the observed trend of limited distribution with populations being mostly small localized and with declining numbers in several subbasins indicates a significant challenge for the species recovery and resilience against further threats Catastrophic Events The criterion for recovery includes sufficient spatial distribution of populations to protect against extinction from catastrophic events The limited distribution and decline in populations make H subangulata more susceptible to catastrophic losses from events such as hurricanes droughts or disease outbreaks Agricultural Water Withdrawals Specifically mentioned regarding the Spring Creek subbasin excessive groundwater withdrawals for agricultural use can lead to drying up of creek stretches affecting the habitat availability and quality for H subangulata This could lead to mortalities during periods of low water availability Potential Effects of Hurricane Michael While the longterm impacts are unknown the immediate physical alteration of creek habitats due to fallen trees and debris could lead to increased sediment load and altered flow regimes negatively impacting H subangulataThese identified threats highlight the complex interplay of anthropogenic and natural factors

November  Rules and Regulations analysis is unclear on whether waterrelated values represent water demands required to realize the current state or if waterrelated values represent value changes in the current state Our Response Section  of the FEA includes an analysis of impacts to agriculture and recreation that follows a costofillness approach It measures the expected monetary losses associated with conserving the seven mussels and does not reflect the marginal value of water The analysis in Section  also assumes alternative water management options that are unknown As such the analysis cannot capture the economic efficiency of conservation efforts for the seven mussels Furthermore as data are unavailable to quantify the change in water value under alternative water management that might occur in the future the FEA cannot present the economic efficiency of alternative water management options or the economic efficiency associated with changes in water availability  Comment One commenter indicates that although the DEA uses casual modeling the study does not meet the minimal standards for policy analysis The analysis seems to make extensive use of expert judgment to fill in gaps rather than examining all possible alternative scenarios Furthermore the analysis does not consider all the available information Our Response The FEA uses the best information available to estimate potential impacts of mussel conservation on water management and use and uses newly available information to increase the accuracy of the agricultural impacts The FEA does use expert judgment to augment available information and incorporates suggested data and information to characterize the range of potential impacts to recreation and to agriculture  Comment Several commenters indicated that the DEA does not estimate the impacts of conservation efforts on industries that use and discharge water such as commercial nurseries saw mills in the lower Flint and Chipola Rivers and companies that conduct activities in rivers such as deadhead loggers Our Response The DEA applies the best information available to estimate potential impacts to recreation and agriculture As discussed in Section  and Section  of the FEA the best currently available information is insufficient to estimate potential impacts to some industries that use and discharge water such as commercial nurseries saw mills and deadhead logging  Comment A few commenters stated that the analysis of the cost associated with future transportation and channel dredging is too cursory to be useful Our Response Section  of the FEA limits the dredging cost analysis to Charlotte Harbor and the Chipola River Without further information about traffic the water depth required for efficient navigation harbors or channels other potential dredging impacts are speculative  Comment Several commenters questioned why the DEA did not explicitly investigate impacts to hydropower production on the Chattahoochee River particularly from flow alternatives outlined in the Modified IOP Our Response The FEA did not estimate impacts to hydropower production because the Modified IOP impacts were described as coextensive with the section  consultation process for gulf sturgeon in  The only available information to estimate hydropower impacts ie  Deheadaching Agreement was specific to another listed species ie gulf sturgeon The gulf sturgeon analysis however is based on the same conservation effort ie Modified IOP that is considered to fully coextensive with the seven mussels conservation efforts The gulf sturgeon consultation also set in action the Modified IOP water management at Jim Woodruff Dam that benefits the mussels Costs associated with these changes in water management caused by proposed designations of critical habitat would already have been borne by hydropower interests  Comment A few commenters requested that deforestation and land conversion in the riparian zone be addressed in the DEA Our Response While the upper boundary of critical habitat for the seven mussels is defined as the ordinary high water mark logging could affect conditions in the stream channel and thus the Physical and Biological Features PBFs essential to the conservation of the mussels The FEA addresses logging impacts when considering how deadhead logging might be affected by critical habitat and whether conservation efforts to prevent water pollution and maintain the PBFs through logging BMPs will result in increased cost to the logging industry,True,False,federal rule regulation

agricultural land use can lead to elevated levels of nutrients eg nitrogen phosphorus and pesticides in nearby water bodies Urban runoff can also contribute a wide range of pollutants including metals oils road salts and chemicals from industrial and residential areas Additionally the alteration of water chemistry such as changes in pH salinity and temperature can occur as a result of various human activities Discharges from industrial processes may alter water temperature or pH impacting mussel survival and reproduction Salinization from road deicing salts or oil and gas extraction processes can increase water salinity beyond the tolerance levels of freshwater mussels Climate change is expected to further contribute to changes in water temperature and potentially the concentration of contaminants as water volume in habitats fluctuates with changes in precipitation patterns and evaporation ratesWater quality impairments from both contamination and altered water chemistry can negatively impact the Rio Grande mussels by affecting their health growth reproduction and survival The presence of toxic substances can lead to direct mortality or sublethal effects that reduce fitness such as impaired immune function or reduced reproductive success Changes in water chemistry can stress or directly kill individuals if conditions move outside their tolerance ranges Given the sensitivity of freshwater mussels to water quality ongoing and future impairments represent significant threats to the persistence of these speciesAltered Hydrology and Loss of FlowFreshwater mussels are adapted to specific flow regimes which influence their distribution within stream systems Flow alterations from dam operations water withdrawals for agricultural industrial or municipal use and impervious surface runoff from urban development can disrupt these natural flow regimes The construction of dams and reservoirs including those upstream of mussel habitats can modify the natural flow regime reduce peak flows necessary for sediment transport and alter temperature regimes downstreamFor the Rio Grande mussels altered hydrology may lead to changes in habitat availability and suitability Reductions in streamflow can lead to habitat fragmentation concentration of pollutants increased temperature and reduced dissolved oxygen levels Reduced flow conditions can also exacerbate sediment deposition as mentioned earlier affecting substrate quality Extended periods of low flow or dewatering can leave mussels exposed and vulnerable to predation desiccation and temperature extremesPersistent low flows can hinder the dispersal and recruitment processes crucial for maintaining genetic diversity and population connectivity For example host fish may be less able to move between different mussel populations reducing the chances of successful glochidia attachment and juvenile recruitment In the case of the Rio Grande mussels the role of flow in their lifecycle and the negative impacts of altered hydrology underscore the importance of maintaining natural flow regimes for their conservationBarriers to Fish MovementSpecific to the Mexican fawnsfoot barriers to fish movement such as dams and poorly designed road crossings can have significant impacts on mussel populations These barriers can block host fish from accessing habitats upstream or downstream limiting the dispersal of mussel larvae glochidia that rely on fish for transport Reduced host fish mobility can lead to decreased mussel genetic diversity and isolate populations making them more vulnerable to local extinctionsClimate ChangeClimate change exacerbates many of the threats faced by the Rio Grande mussels Increased frequency and severity of droughts can reduce water availability further altering flow regimes and increasing water temperatures Extreme weather events such as heavy rains following droughts can lead to increased runoff and sedimentation as well as sudden spikes in pollutant concentrations Climate change may also alter the distribution and abundance of host fish species impacting mussel reproduction and dispersalConservation EffortsVarious conservation efforts are underway to address threats to the Rio Grande mussels including habitat restoration pollution control measures and efforts to maintain or replicate natural flow regimes Research into the biology

identified threats include Habitat Alteration and Destruction    Impoundment Artificial barriers such as dams can alter natural flow regimes water temperature and sediment transport radically changing mussel habitat    Siltation Increased sedimentation from surface runoff due to agriculture deforestation construction and mining activities smothers mussel beds depriving them of oxygen and food Pollution    Coal mining activities particularly in the Powell River drainage introduce harmful pollutants into the water such as heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs which can be detrimental to mussel health and reproduction    The construction of a coalfired power plant in the Clinch River is expected to increase demands for coal potentially exacerbating mining activities and associated pollution Water Withdrawal    Increased water extraction for municipal agricultural and industrial uses can reduce water flow substantially impacting habitat quality for these mussels Altered Flow Regimes    Dam operations can modify natural river flow patterns affecting the mussels life cycle Coldwater releases from dams can also disrupt the thermal regimes necessary for mussel survival Reduced Genetic Variation and Population Fragmentation    Small isolated populations are more susceptible to genetic drift and inbreeding reducing genetic diversity and the species ability to adapt to environmental changes Inadequate Regulatory Mechanisms    Existing regulations may fail to protect the species from habitat loss and degradation due to development mining and other human activities This includes a lack of comprehensive federal protection for habitat outside the regulatory reach of the Endangered Species Act Impacts of Climate Change   Although not explicitly detailed in the text provided climate change poses a longterm threat to freshwater mussels by altering water temperatures and flow patterns which could further exacerbate existing threats and introduce new challenges for the survival of Theliderma intermedia Lack of Recruitments    Evidence suggests that there are challenges with recruitment ie the addition of younger individuals to the population which

significant threat to this species Disease or Predation No new information indicating that disease or predation is a limiting factor for the species Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms   a Although the species is listed as endangered by the states of Tennessee and Virginia theres a lack of regulatory mechanisms addressing protections from nonfederally regulated activities that threaten habitat and the species itself   b Many activities impacting the species survival or recovery such as residential and commercial development road construction and runoff as well as agriculture and forestry operations are regulated only by state and local governments which may lack sufficient ordinances to protect the species and its habitat from effects of development and other land use activities   c Federal actions that are subject to Section  of the Endangered Species Act provide some level of protection but not all adverse effects from these activities have been eliminated CoalRelated Problems and Substrate Quality in the Powell River The increasing coal mining and associated activities threaten the existence of Theliderma intermedia in the Powell River by contributing

kosteri based on the provided text encompass a range of environmental and humaninduced factors that impact its habitat and survival These include Reduction of Water in Springs The survival of Juturnia kosteri like other invertebrates mentioned is heavily dependent on spring habitats The loss or alteration of these aquiferfed spring habitats due to human activities like irrigation and municipal use which can lower water tables pose significant threats Historical evidence shows the depletion of aquifers leading to dry springs reducing available habitats for these species Water Contamination The potential for water contamination particularly from oil and gas operations within the watershed areas feeding the springs is a significant concern The surrounding areas of their habitats are noted to have multiple oil and gas wells and activities that could lead to contamination of the aquifers supporting these springs Such contamination could severely impact the sensitive aquatic ecosystems where Juturnia kosteri resides Fire Wildfires and prescribed burns pose threats to Juturnia kosteri by altering their habitats Fires can lead to the removal of vegetative cover change in water temperature decrease in dissolved oxygen levels and increase in invasive species These changes can reduce the suitability of habitats for Juturnia kosteri and impact its abundance and distribution Aquifer Depletion Overpumping of groundwater for agriculture or other uses can lead to the failure of spring flows which would result in habitat loss for species dependent on these spring systems Aquifer depletion directly affects the volume and quality of water feeding the springs which are crucial for Juturnia kosteris survival Habitat fragmentation and isolation The isolated and fragmented nature of spring ecosystems makes them particularly vulnerable to changes Limited connectivity between habitats can reduce genetic diversity and resilience against environmental changes Potential impacts of Climate Change Although not explicitly mentioned factors like climate change can exacerbate existing threats through increased temperatures altered precipitation patterns and increased severity of droughts or floods affecting the quality and availability of aquatic habitats Human Development Expansion of urban areas and associated landscape changes can further stress the spring habitats through

River spiny mussel Elliptio steinstansana based on the review include Habitat Degradation and Fragmentation Largescale land use changes such as forestry operations agricultural practices and residentialcommercial development have led to habitat fragmentation increased sedimentation runoff and pollution These changes result in loss of riparian buffers alteration of stream hydrology and degradation of aquatic habitats impacting the survival of the mussel populations Water Quality Point source and nonpoint source pollution from agricultural runoff wastewater discharges and stormwater runoff threaten water quality Excessive pesticide runoff and discharge have been implicated in massive dieoffs of the mussel Low Genetic Variation Due to extremely small population sizes and potential isolation there are concerns about the genetic variability and viability of populations This genetic bottleneck might limit the populations ability to reproduce adapt and recover Invasive Species The Asiatic clam Corbicula fluminea invasion poses a threat through potential competition for food space and oxygen particularly affecting juvenile mussels Drought and Climate Variability Prolonged drought conditions reduce water levels affecting habitat quality and availability Drought exacerbates the concentration of pollutants and increases vulnerability to predation and mortality due to exposure Impediments to Reproduction The fragmented and small populations might be experiencing limited reproductive success due to the disproportional distribution of males and females affecting the mussels ability to find mates and reproduce effectively Land Clearing and Development Specific incidents of land clearing resulting in sediment runoff directly into mussel habitats have been documented indicating ongoing threats from development activities Timber Operations Extensive clearcutting especially within watersheds supporting the mussel populations has resulted in significant
