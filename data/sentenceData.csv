"Arroyo toads require two habitats to complete their annual life cycle: low-gradient streams with sandy, gravelly soils (aquatic breeding habitat) and terrestrial uplands with sandy soils for foraging and overwintering (upland habitat; Sweet 1992, pp. 23–28; Mitrovich et al. 2011, pp. 319, 323–327).",Non-target
"Reproduction is dependent upon the availability of very shallow, still, or low-flow pools within streams where breeding, egg-laying, and tadpole development occur.",Non-target
"The ongoing threat of habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation due to urbanization and agriculture is slowly being countered by aquatic and upland habitat conservation and restoration across the arroyo toad distribution.",Threat
"Functional, ecological water flows in dammed and diverted streams are crucial for arroyo toad survival, reproduction, and persistence, especially when facing the growing threat of extended drought, drying breeding pools, and subsequent reproductive failure associated with global climate change (Avery in litt. 2022, pp. 4–5).",Threat
"At the time of listing, we identified the following primary threats to arroyo toad: habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation (including mining and prospecting); operation of dams and water diversions; competition with introduced non-native plants and animals; predation from introduced non-native animals; drought and wildfire; and light and noise pollution from adjacent developments and campgrounds (59 FR 64862–64865).",Threat
"Conduct spatiotemporally replicated surveys at historical and recent arroyo toad occurrences using USGS’s (2023, unpubl. data) site-prioritization tool to assess arroyo toad population status—including quantification of various life stages (e.g., larvae, juveniles, adults)—and initiate conservation efforts (e.g., habitat restoration).",Recommendation
"mplement functional-flow studies and management experiments (e.g., pulsed water releases) within dammed streams—during periods of prolonged drought—to control nonnative species and sustain arroyo toad populations over time.",Recommendation
"Establish new conservation easements for the benefit of the arroyo toad across the Northern, Desert, and Southern Recovery Units, and deploy USGS’s (2023, unpubl. data) site-prioritization tool to support associated decision making about strategic land acquisitions",Recommendation
"Evaluate arroyo toad population- and individual-level responses to wildfire, drought, and climate change, and conduct arroyo toad headstarting and translocations (e.g., via assisted migration and reintroduction; i.e., population enhancement) to house captive-breeding stock, augment the abundance of wild populations, and preserve genetic diversity under a Best Management Practices’ framework to address threats from wildfire, drought, and climate change.",Recommendation

"California red-legged frogs are “irruptive” breeders where their breeding capacity is highly dependent on local environmental conditions, specifically the availability of cool water for egg deposition and larval maturation (Jennings and Hayes 1994, p. 62).",Non-target
"The final listing rule for the California red-legged frog (Service 1996, pp. 25824–25830) listed the following factors as threats to the viability of the species: (1) urban encroachment, (2) construction of large and small reservoirs, water diversions and well development, (3) flood control maintenance, (4) road maintenance, (5) placer mining, (6) livestock grazing and feral pigs, (7) off-road vehicle use, and (8) introduction or presence of exotic predators and competitors",Threat
"Contrastingly, populations south of Santa Barbara County are under intense threat from urbanization.",Threat
"Develop a range-wide long-term monitoring plan to evaluate if populations are stable and increasing, including specific long-term study sites.",Recommendation
Work with private landowners to further conservation of California red-legged frog on private lands in the Sierra Nevada.,Recommendation
"Continue to promote habitat protection and conservation in Mendocino County at the northern extent of the species range, and formally standardize a Service-approved protocol for eDNA surveys so the species status can be accurately studied and distinguished from the similar sympatric species, Northern red-legged frogs (Rana aurora).",Recommendation
Continue to research habitat use and movement of California red-legged frog in the Sierra Nevada.,Recommendation
"The Service finalized a 5-year review for spruce-fir moss spider in 2014, recommending the species remain classified as endangered because of its small/isolated populations with likely limited gene flow and significant threats from habitat loss/fragmentation, introduced pests, pollution, and climate change.",Threat
"Finalize a long-term monitoring plan for the species and initiate its implementation, including development of a database to store data from past and future survey efforts.",Recommendation
Work with partners to generate estimates of the number of individuals needed for a viable population and refine as we learn more.,Recommendation
