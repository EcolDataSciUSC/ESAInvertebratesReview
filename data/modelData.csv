"2",51,5052,"Gastropoda","Elimia crenatella","ReviewURLs","https://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/4028.pdf","Based on the information provided, the identified threats to **Elimia crenatella** (Lacy Elimia) include:

1. **Habitat Loss and Degradation:** The summary doesn't detail specific causes of habitat loss, but the general issues affecting aquatic snails typically include water pollution, sedimentation, dam construction, and other alterations to natural water flow which can lead to habitat degradation and loss. These factors are implied rather than directly stated in the provided text.

2. **Restricted Distribution:** The Lacy Elimia has a limited distribution range. It's currently known from one primary location, lower Cheaha Creek, with two populations having been extirpated since its listing. This restricted distribution makes the species especially vulnerable to extirpation due to localized threats.

3. **Lack of Recovery Progress:** The criteria for the speciesâ€™ recovery, including having a minimum of 3 populations shown to be persistent for a period of 10 years, have not been met. This indicates ongoing vulnerability and possibly ongoing or unmitigated threats to the species' survival.

4. **Lack of Standardized Monitoring Plans:** There is an absence of standardized annual monitoring plans for the Lacy Elimia, as well as other species discussed. This lack of consistent and systemic monitoring indicates a threat in terms of insufficient data to adequately assess population trends, threats, and recovery needs.

5. **Water Quality and Habitat Protection:** Comments provided during the review process highlighted the importance of water quality and aquatic habitat. Although specific to the Black Warrior River drainage and other species, these comments reflect broader concerns applicable to freshwater mollusks like the Lacy Elimia. Declines in water quality, due to pollutants, runoff, and altered stream flow, threaten aquatic habitats. 

6. **Low Recovery Potential:** Based on the recovery priority system, although not directly categorized here for Lacy Elimia, species with higher threat levels and lower recovery potentials demand significant management efforts to mitigate threats. The challenges reflected in meeting the outlined recovery criteria suggest Lacy Elimia might also have low recovery potential without substantial conservation efforts.

In summary, while not all threats to Elimia crenatella are explicitly detailed, implicit threats include habitat loss and degradation, limited and diminishing distribution, water quality issues, and inadequate monitoring and recovery efforts. These factors collectively contribute to the speciesâ€™ continued status as threatened.",TRUE,NA,"5052ReviewURLshttps://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/4028.pdf","Melissa",5052,"Gastropoda","Elimia crenatella","ReviewURLs","https://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/4028.pdf","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

1. **Recreational Impacts:** Increased recreational activity, particularly in areas like Coopers Rock State Forest, poses a threat due to potential habitat destruction from hiking, biking, and rock climbing. The creation of new trails and off-trail activity by visitors can crush snails and reduce leaf litter, which is crucial for the snails' survival.

2. **Fire:** Fire, whether natural, accidental, or prescribed, poses a significant threat to the snail's habitat. Fires can kill snails directly and significantly reduce the leaf litter layer, impacting the snails' foraging habitat and potential survival.

3. **Timber Harvesting:** While the state ownership of land has reduced the threat of private logging, timber harvesting activities, if not properly managed, could still pose a threat to the snail's habitat. The existence of buffers during timber operations helps, but the effectiveness of these buffers remains a question.

4. **Coal Mining and Other Mineral Development:** The development of mineral resources like coal, limestone, and natural gas within the Cheat Canyon poses a potential threat to the snail's habitat. Even though most of the land is publicly owned, some mineral rights are privately owned or only partially owned by the state, allowing for possible development that could damage or destroy snail habitats.

5. **Climate Change:** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided sections, climate change is a global threat that can affect habitats and species distribution, potentially impacting the Flat-spired Three-toothed Land Snail's survival indirectly through alterations in its preferred moist and cool habitat conditions.

6. **Predation and Natural or Man-made Factors:** The text alludes to the fact that predation (Factor C) and other natural or man-made factors (Factor E) have been identified as potential threats, but the need for their inclusion in recovery criteria is uncertain. This suggests there may be more threats not fully explored or understood in the current analysis.

1. **Habitat Degradation and Sedimentation:**
   - Chronic turbidity and sedimentation impacting mussel species.
   - Flooding events (e.g., hurricanes Frances and Ivan in 2004) causing landslides and destabilizing river banks, leading to ongoing habitat degradation.

2. **Environmental Pollution:**
   - Chemical spill reported in the Cane River in 2008, affecting mussel population viability.
   - Effluent from the Evergreen paper mill in Canton, NC, despite improvements, creating an environment unsuitable for Appalachian elktoe due to waste heat and tannic effluent.

3. **Human Activities and Land Use Changes:**
   - Development within watersheds and several hydro power operations causing water to rise and fall rapidly and discharge cold water into the habitat impacting mussel populations, particularly in the Tuckaseegee River.
   - Rural and agricultural activity in watersheds (e.g., Pigeon River and East Fork Pigeon), potentially limiting mussel density and extent.

4. **Physical Barriers:**
   - Dams and reservoirsthat block upstream migration of the species and segment populations (e.g., Lake Logan Dam, Cascade Lake Dam).
    
5. **Climate Change and Temperature Variability:**
   - Potential impact from high temperatures particularly noted in the discussions regarding the Nolichucky River populations.

6. **Low Population Density and Viability:**
   - Declines in mussel population density making them vulnerable to extinction.
   - The need for significant habitat improvements and protections to stabilize or increase populations.

7. **Genetic Isolation and Fragmentation:**
   - Populations are separated by impoundments (e.g., between segments of the Little Tennessee River population) and potentially degraded habitats, which could limit gene flow and increase vulnerability.

8. **Limited Recruitment and Reproductive Success:**
   - Observations of limited reproducing individuals in certain populations and reduced evidence of juvenile recruitment in key areas.

1. **Habitat Degradation**: This includes the cumulative impacts of land use change affecting water quality, water quantity, habitat connectivity, and in-stream habitat quality.

2. **Reduced Stream Flow**: Changes in land use, water withdrawals for agriculture, and urbanization can reduce the amount of water flowing in streams and rivers, which is critical for the mussel's survival.

3. **Pollution**: Input from agricultural runoff, urban stormwater, and wastewater can degrade the water quality, affecting the mussel's habitat.

4. **Habitat Fragmentation**: The construction of barriers (such as dams) and the alteration of natural stream courses lead to fragmented populations, reducing gene flow and the species' ability to recolonize areas from which it has been extirpated.

5. **Climate Change**: Increasing temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent or severe droughts are expected to exacerbate the loss of suitable habitat and could affect water temperature and flow, further stressing populations.

6. **Isolation of Populations**: Many of the remaining populations are small and fragmented, making them more vulnerable to extirpation due to stochastic events and reducing their adaptive capacity.

7. **Loss of Resiliency and Redundancy**: Most populations are in low condition or presumed extirpated, severely limiting the species' ability to withstand environmental variability and catastrophic events.

8. **Loss of Representation**: The loss of geographic, genetic, and ecological variability as a result of reduced occupancy across its historic range, particularly in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions, has led to a decrease in the species' overall adaptive capacity and viability.

These threats combine to reduce the viability of the Yellow Lance across its range, with projections under various scenarios indicating a continued decline in most measures of conservation value (resiliency, redundancy, and representation) into the future.",TRUE,NA,"4511SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/189393","Melissa",4511,"Bivalvia","Elliptio lanceolata","SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/189393","",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

These threats include:

1. **Habitat Degradation**: Resulting from cumulative impacts of land use changes that negatively affect water quality, water quantity, habitat connectivity, and in-stream habitat quality.

2. **Pollution**: Contributing to deteriorating water quality, which negatively impacts the species' ability to thrive.

3. **Reduced Stream Flow**: Affecting the quantity of water available, which is crucial for the species' survival. Reduced stream flow can result from various factors including water withdrawals for agricultural, industrial, and domestic use.

4. **Habitat Fragmentation**: Leading to small, isolated populations that are more vulnerable to extirpation due to stochastic events and reduced genetic diversity.

5. **Climate Change**: Manifesting through increasing temperatures and droughts, further exacerbating habitat degradation and impacting the species' range and abundance.

6. **Land Use Change**: Including urbanization and agricultural practices, leading to changes in water quality and quantity, and adding to the species' habitat fragmentation and degradation.

7. **Water Quality and Quantity**: Critical components for the species' viability. Degradation of water quality through pollution, sedimentation, and chemical runoff, combined with altered quantity due to withdrawals and climate change impacts, are significant threats.

1. **Significant Habitat Loss**: This is a major threat to the survival of *Amblema neislerii*, as it directly influences the speciesâ€™ natural living conditions and resources necessary for their survival and reproduction.

2. **Range Restriction**: The limitation in the geographical range where these mussels can live contributes to their vulnerability. A limited range means that any further threats to their habitat can have more devastating impacts on their populations.

3. **Population Fragmentation and Size Reduction**: The division of populations into smaller, isolated groups reduces genetic diversity, which can affect the resilience of the species to diseases and environmental changes. Additionally, reduced population size heightens the risk of extinction.

4. **Habitat and Water Quality Alterations**: Changes to the musselsâ€™ natural environments, such as alterations in water flow or quality due to pollution, can have negative effects on their health and ability to reproduce.

5. **Toxic Chemical Spills**: Events like chemical spills can have immediate and severe impacts on mussel populations, especially for those species with already limited distribution and low numbers.

6. **Genetic Isolation**: As populations become fragmented, the opportunities for genetic exchange diminish, which can lead to reduced fitness and adaptability of the species.

7. **Anthropogenic Activities**: Human activities such as impoundments, channelization, erosion due to inappropriate land uses, construction of new impoundments, water withdrawals, and the introduction of alien species pose significant risks to these mussels.

8. **Little Evidence of Recent Recruitment**: The lack of young mussels joining the population indicates problems in the reproductive success or survival of juveniles, which is crucial for the population's sustainability.

9. **Vulnerability to Catastrophic Events**: Given their already reduced and fragmented populations, catastrophic events could have disproportionately large impacts, possibly leading to local extinctions.

Summarizing from the text, these threats include:

1. **Coal Mining and Urbanization:** Coal mining activities, urban expansion, and associated environmental changes have been highlighted as continuous threats, particularly in watersheds such as the Powell River. These activities lead to habitat destruction, water pollution, and alterations in water flow and sedimentation patterns that adversely affect Fusconaia cor populations.

2. **Agricultural Practices:** Agricultural pollution, due to runoff containing pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals, significantly threatens the water quality and habitat suitability for Fusconaia cor. The review discusses agricultural pollution potentially related to catastrophic population declines, especially noted in the North Fork Holston River.

3. **Toxic Chemical Spills:** Spills of toxic chemicals from various sources including industrial and mining operations can lead to immediate and severe impacts on populations of Fusconaia cor, eliminating large numbers of individuals or entire populations in affected areas.

4. **Habitat Modification and Loss:** Activities that alter the natural riverine habitats, including dam construction, water withdrawal, and modifications for navigation or flood control, can lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, adversely affecting Fusconaia cor populations. Such modifications can disrupt flow regimes, temperature, and oxygen levels which are critical for the survival of the species.

5. **Inadequate Protection and Management of Habitats:** While efforts are being made to improve stream and river conditions through partnerships and projects, the review suggests that significant threats from continual habitat degradation and insufficient protective measures remain. This includes ineffective management of coal, energy-related impacts, and other anthropogenic activities that continue to compromise the habitats of Fusconaia cor.

6. **Limited Genetic Variation and Propagation Challenges:** The review also touches on concerns regarding the genetic variation and the necessity for propagation technology development. The limited genetic variation due to fragmented populations could affect the species' adaptability, while challenges in developing propagation techniques hinder conservation efforts through augmentation and reintroduction.

7. **Discovery and Recovery Plan Implementation Challenges:** Efforts to discover new populations, re-establish populations in historical ranges, and implement recovery plans face challenges due to the continued presence of threats and the complexity of addressing habitat-related issues.

1. **Habitat Degradation**: Conditions at the historical collection site had degraded significantly, leading to very few mussels of any species being found there, indicating a severe threat from habitat degradation and channel erosion. This has been mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline of the Black Clubshell's population.

2. **Limited Distribution and Population Size**: The Black Clubshell was known to have persisted on a single shoal in the East Fork Tombigbee River through 1997, and all repeated surveys in the area reported significant channel erosion, decline of the mussel fauna, and the absence of Black Clubshell. This very limited distribution and decline in population size have left the species extremely vulnerable.

3. **Difficulty in Monitoring and Propagation**: Due to mussels being cryptic species, sometimes burying deeply in the river bottom, monitoring efforts are complex and challenging. Additionally, there are no direct threats mentioned regarding unsuccessful propagation efforts for the Black Clubshell like those mentioned for Heavy Pigtoe, but it can be inferred that such difficulties would also be a threat to its survival.

4. **Potential for Extinction**: Given the repeated unsuccessful surveys and significant habitat degradation, the document suggests that although the Black Clubshell may be extinct, additional monitoring is warranted before making a final determination. The potential extinction of the species itself is a significant threat to its continued existence.

Recovery efforts that have been implemented or recommended focus on continued monitoring and habitat stabilization in the areas where Black Clubshell was historically found, indicating that conservation strategies are aware of these threats and are attempting to mitigate them.

However, predation may become more significant in areas where the populations are already stressed by other factors such as reduced stream flows, habitat degradation, or barriers limiting dispersion and genetic exchange.

Scientific collecting can also result in direct mortality if not conducted with the objective of minimizing harm to populations. Although collecting can provide valuable information about species distributions, status, and habitat requirements, improper or excessive collection can negatively impact populations, especially those that are already small or isolated. Some states regulate the collection of endangered or threatened species, including freshwater mussels, to prevent detrimental impacts. Recreational collection, typically conducted without permits and potentially at higher frequencies or intensities, poses a similar risk.

While direct mortality from natural predators or human activities may not typically threaten the overall viability of Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe species, these factors can have localized impacts. In combination with other stressors such as altered hydrology, habitat degradation, and water quality issues, direct mortality can contribute to the decline of sensitive or isolated populations.

Overall, the conservation status of the Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe is influenced by a complex interplay of threats, including changes in water quality, altered hydrology, changes to habitat structure and substrate, habitat fragmentation, and direct mortality from predation and human activities.

Additionally, freshwater mussels can be sensitive to changes in dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, and temperature, among other water quality parameters. In the portion of Rio Grande inhabited by the Salina mucket and Mexican fawnsfoot, water quality is influenced by wastewater discharges, agricultural runoff, urban runoff, and natural processes.

Water quality in the Rio Grande is influenced by numerous factors, including wastewater discharge from urban areas both in the United States and Mexico. Rapid population growth and industrialization, particularly in the Mexican side of the border, has stressed existing wastewater treatment facilities, leading to high sediment loads and impaired water quality downstream. Agricultural activities, including irrigation return flows, also contribute nutrients, pesticides, and other contaminants to the river. Urban development leads to increased impervious surfaces, altering runoff patterns and increasing pollutant loads during rain events. Additionally, natural processes can affect water quality; for example, evaporation can concentrate salts in the river, increasing salinity levels and affecting mussel viability.

Hydrologic Alteration and Loss of Flow
Changes in natural flow regimes can have significant impacts on freshwater mussels, affecting their growth, reproduction, and survival. Hydrologic alterations in the Rio Grande, including water diversion for irrigation and urban uses, reservoir operations, and channel modifications for flood control and navigation, have altered the natural flow and thermal regimes to which these mussels and their host fish are adapted. Impoundments create barriers to fish movement and change upstream and downstream flow patterns, impacting mussel dispersal and recruitment. Reduced flows can lead to habitat fragmentation and isolation, increased water temperatures, decreased dissolved oxygen levels, and impaired water quality, all of which can be detrimental to freshwater mussel populations.

Barriers to Fish Movement
Freshwater mussels rely on specific fish species for the dispersal of their larvae (glochidia). Barriers such as dams, weirs, and culverts can impede the movement of host fish, limiting mussel dispersal and gene flow between populations. For Mexican fawnsfoot, which has specialized relationships with molluscivorous fish like freshwater drum, barriers to fish movement can particularly limit the species' ability to recolonize areas after local extirpations or stochastic events. Disruption of these host-parasite relationships due to impaired fish movement can have significant impacts on population dynamics and genetic diversity of mussels.

Climate Change
Ongoing and expected effects of climate change, including increased frequency and severity of droughts, altered precipitation patterns leading to changes in flow regimes, and increases in temperature, exacerbate other threats such as habitat loss, water quality degradation, and hydrologic alteration. Climate change can lead to more extreme weather events, altering the natural disturbance regimes that mussels and their ecosystems have adapted to. Reduced streamflow and increased water temperatures can stress mussel populations directly and indirectly by affecting host fish viability and changing community dynamics. Climate change may also facilitate the spread of non-native species and diseases, further impacting freshwater mussel populations.

Conservation Efforts
Various conservation efforts are underway to address the threats to Salina mucket and Mexican fawnsfoot, including habitat restoration, water quality improvement projects, and research on freshwater mussel biology and ecology. Collaboration between state, federal, and international agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations and academic institutions, is critical to the success of these efforts. Conservation measures targeting broader watershed and ecosystem health can also benefit these and other freshwater mussel species by improving water quality, restoring natural flow regimes, and enhancing habitat connectivity.",TRUE,NA,"9879SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/185478","Melissa",9879,"Bivalvia","Obovaria subrotunda","SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/185478","",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

These threats can be broadly categorized under habitat degradation or loss, contaminants, impact from agricultural activities, barriers to migration such as dams, resource extraction activities, invasive species, and genetic isolation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the identified threats:

1. **Habitat Degradation or Loss**: 
  - **Development/Urbanization**: Expansion of urban areas leads to habitat loss and alteration, affecting the mussel's living conditions.
  - **Transportation**: Construction and maintenance of transportation infrastructure can disrupt habitats.
  
2. **Contaminants**: Pollution from various sources impacts the water quality and directly affects the health and survival of the mussel population.

3. **Agricultural Activities**: 
  - **Nutrient Pollution**: Excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff can lead to algal blooms, reducing oxygen levels in water and harming mussels.
  - **Pumping for Irrigation**: Draws down water levels, potentially stranding populations or altering their habitat.
  - **Agricultural Exemptions from Permit Requirements**: Lack of regulatory oversight for some agricultural discharges can lead to increased risk of pollution.

4. **Dams and Barriers**: Interrupt the natural flow of rivers, impact sediment transport, and can block the movement of aquatic species, isolating populations.

5. **Changing Climate Conditions**: Altered rainfall patterns, temperatures, and extreme weather events can significantly affect aquatic ecosystems.

6. **Resource Extraction**:
  - **Coal Mining**: Can lead to acid mine drainage, contaminating waterways with heavy metals and other pollutants.
  - **Natural Gas Extraction and Gravel Mining/Dredging**: Can lead to habitat disruption and increased sedimentation.

7. **Invasive and Nonnative Species**: Species such as the Zebra Mussel outcompete native mussels for food and space, and can directly attach to and smother native mussels.

8. **Genetic Isolation and Displacement**: Small, scattered populations are more susceptible to genetic bottleneck effects, reducing genetic diversity and adaptive potential.

9. **Factors Currently Believed To Have Limited Effects**: This includes aspects that currently do not seem to have a major direct impact but are notable, such as harvest and overutilization, host fishes, enigmatic population declines, parasites, and predation.

These threats, combined with future scenarios that contemplate constant negative influences, decreased negative influences due to conservation efforts, and increased negative influences, indicate that the Round Hickorynut Mussel faces considerable challenges. The projections suggest potential declines in population and distribution under most future scenarios, highlighting the need for targeted conservation efforts to address these threats and improve the species' long-term viability.",TRUE,NA,"9879CriticalHabitatDesignationURLshttps://www.govinfo.gov/link/fr/88/14794","Melissa",9879,"Bivalvia","Obovaria subrotunda","CriticalHabitatDesignationURLs","https://www.govinfo.gov/link/fr/88/14794","We have determined that the longsolid and round hickorynut are threatened species due to the following threats: habitat degradation or loss (Factor A) from a variety of sources (e.g., dams and other barriers, resource extraction); degraded water quality from chemical contamination and erosion from development, agriculture, mining, and forest conversion (Factor A); direct mortality from dredging (Factor E); residual impacts (reduced population size) from historical harvest (Factor B); and the proliferation of invasive, nonnative species (Factor E).

1. **Coal-Related Problems and Substrate Quality Decline**: The populations of Birdwing pearlymussel in the Powell River and Clinch River are adversely affected by coal fines, resulting in declining populations due to impacts on water quality and substrate suitability for the mussels.

2. **Adverse Effects from Development and Construction Activities**: Despite existing federal and state laws and regulations intended to protect these species, their habitats continue to be affected by various construction and development activities. These activities can result in habitat degradation, increased sedimentation, and changes in water chemistry that are harmful to the mussels.

3. **Agriculture and Highway Construction**: Activities associated with agriculture and highway construction contribute to the degradation of habitats. These may include inputs of pollutants, alterations to natural water flow, and direct habitat loss or fragmentation.

4. **Pollution from the Coal Industry**: Pollution related to the coal industry, specifically contaminants such as copper, lead, mercury, and ammonia, has been partially investigated. These contaminants accumulate in the tissues of mussels and are toxic at relatively low concentrations, though the full extent of the effects is not fully known.

5. **Lack of Information on Specific Habitat and Ecological Requirements**: While general habitat preferences are known, there's a lack of specific, detailed information on the habitat and ecological requirements for all life history stages of the Birdwing pearlymussel. This gap in knowledge hampers efforts to protect and recover populations effectively.

6. **Non-Point Source Pollution**: Contributions to the decline of populations in the Elk River and mainstream Tennessee River are attributed to reservoir operations and non-point source pollution, affecting the overall health and viability of the habitats these mussels rely on.

7. **Sedimentation and Water Quality Degradation**: Actions that result in sedimentation of streams and reductions in dissolved oxygen or changes in temperature likely have adverse effects on the Birdwing pearlymussel, as sedimentation can bury mussels and alter their habitats, while changes in water chemistry can directly affect their survival.

It involves the designation of 26 river and stream segments as critical habitat, meant to provide protection and conservation measures for three threatened and eight endangered freshwater mussel species.

The document addresses various aspects related to the critical habitat designation, including the legal and procedural framework, background information on the mussel species, consultation history, economic analysis, and public comments received during the rule-making process. Specific threats to the mussel species, such as habitat destruction, pollution, and competition from non-native species like Corbicula fluminea, are discussed as key factors affecting their survival.

One of the mussel species explicitly mentioned in the document is the Alabama moccasinshell (*Medionidus acutissimus*), which, along with the other species, faces threats from limited habitat, small population size, competition or predation from nonnative species like the Asian clam (*Corbicula fluminea*), zebra (*Dreissena polymorpha*), and quagga (*D. bugensis*) mussels, and black carp (*Mylopharyngodon piceus*). The potential introduction or establishment of these competing and predatory non-native species in the Mobile River Basin poses a significant threat to the native freshwater mussels, including the Alabama moccasinshell.

Finally, the document elaborates on the Service's position regarding the designation of critical habitat, addressing comments and concerns raised by the public, and explains how designated critical habitats are identified based on the presence of primary constituent elements essential for the conservation of the species.

1. **Habitat Degradation**: Agricultural activities in the watershed along with the presence of oil and gas extraction wells and pipelines have led to habitat degradation. This affects the water quality and substrate that are critical for the survival and reproduction of Epioblasma obliquata.

2. **Low Population Size and Recruitment Issues**: The species faces long-term viability concerns due to very small population sizes that are concentrated in restricted areas. For example, the population in Killbuck Creek is very small and concentrated in one riffle, raising concerns about its long-term viability despite some recruitment occurring based on the finding of young individuals.

3. **Genetic Concerns**: A genetic assessment has revealed little to no genetic variation at the mitochondrial DNA gene ND1, indicating that the Killbuck Creek population has been through a recent bottleneck. Although heterozygosity and allelic richness values were moderately low, indicating some level of genetic diversity, the issue of genetic representation and lack thereof remains a concern for the species.

4. **Exposure to Stochastic Events**: While the foreseeable threats to reintroduced populations are minimal, exposure to stochastic events such as spills and the potential effects of climate change (e.g., flooding, drought, and increased water temperatures) cannot be ruled out.

5. **Slow Progress in Recovery Efforts**: While there are ongoing efforts for the species' recovery, including dam removals to restore stream systems to free-flowing conditions and captive propagation for reintroduction, Criterion 1 for downlisting or delisting has not been met due to the lack of documented reproduction and recruitment in the reintroduced populations. Furthermore, the threats under listing factor A, including the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat or range, have not been fully mitigated.

1. **Non-native Crayfish**: Specifically, the expansion of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and northern crayfish (Faxonius virilis) into the range of Shasta crayfish, posing significant threats through predation and competition. The signal crayfish, in particular, noted for its larger size, aggressive nature, and higher fecundity, has become a dominant competitor throughout the Shasta crayfish range.

2. **Hydroelectric Projects**: The development of hydroelectric generation facilities and associated infrastructure has led to habitat loss and alteration, significantly impacting Shasta crayfish populations by creating physical barriers and modifying stream flows.

3. **Agricultural and Residential Development**: This includes impacts from water diversion and impoundment projects that have led to habitat loss and alteration. While certain specific impacts from development were considered no longer significant threats as of the last review, the overall habitat modification from these activities remains a concern.

4. **Water Pollution**: Degradation of water quality from various sources, including possibly increased pollution levels related to development and agricultural activities, poses a threat to the highly specialized habitat requirements of the Shasta crayfish.

5. **Crayfishing**: Initially predicted to be a minor threat at the time of listing, subsequent reviews found no data to support crayfishing as a current threat. This indicates that while direct human harvesting might not pose an immediate concern, earlier assessments considered it a potential risk.

6. **Environmental Factors Influenced by Human Activities**: This includes maintenance and operational activities associated with hatchery management, restoration, and improvement of wild trout habitat as additional pressures that may influence the species' survival.

7. **Climate Change**: The vulnerability of Shasta crayfish to climate change is highlighted by their requirement for cold, slow-moving, spring-fed waters. Predicted changes, such as temperature increases and altered precipitation patterns, could further reduce water quality and availability in their specialized habitat.

8. **Low Genetic Diversity and Population Fragmentation**: Small population size and increased habitat fragmentation heighten the species' vulnerability to genetic bottlenecks, stochastic events, and reduced capacity for recolonization.

1. **Habitat Destruction and Modification (Factor A):** The primary identified threat to the Delta Green Ground Beetle is the destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat, especially due to urban development, agriculture, and invasive species. The beetle's habitat is largely restricted to vernal pools, which are themselves threatened ecosystems. Although some habitats are protected within preserves, conservation easements, and conservation banks, there's still a significant portion of the beetle's known occurrences on unprotected private lands, including areas not surveyed and, thus, remain unprotected.

2. **Degradation of Habitat by Invasive Plants (Factor A):** The invasion of non-native plants into the beetle's habitat is a significant concern, as these invasive species can change the character of vernal pools, potentially making them unsuitable for the beetle. Management plans that address grazing practices, controlled burns, and the application of herbicides to control invasive plants partially address this threat.

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Management Plans:** Although management plans exist for certain areas, consistent and comprehensive management across all known and potential habitats of the Delta Green Ground Beetle is necessary to ensure the preservation of its habitat and to facilitate population viability.

4. **Insufficient Research and Data:** A major obstacle to the beetle's conservation is the lack of detailed understanding of its life cycle, habitat preferences, and population dynamics. There is a need for ongoing research into the biology and ecology of the beetle, including mortality rates, productivity, dispersal mechanisms, and preferred habitat conditions.

5. **Lack of Coordinated Conservation Efforts:** The need for a recovery implementation team to oversee recovery actions and the formation of multiple working groups at the vernal pool region level indicates a requirement for more coordinated efforts in conservation actions, outreach programs, and stakeholder involvement.

6. **Climate and Environmental Factors:** Although not explicitly mentioned as a primary threat, the beetle's reliance on vernal pool habitats suggests that changes in climate, rainfall patterns, and hydrology could impact its survival indirectly by affecting the vernal pool ecosystems.

These threats encompass several factors under the Endangered Species Act, primarily Factor A (destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range).

2. **Anthropogenic Activities**: While currently minimal due to protective measures at Big Spring, potential human-induced stressors include surface water contamination, habitat destruction, substrate removal, or the introduction of invasive species. These activities could severely impact the beetle's habitat if not properly managed.

3. **Lack of Redundancy**: The beetle's existence is known only from a single location, Big Spring at Historic Lake Scott State Park. This lack of multiple populations reduces its ability to withstand catastrophic events, making the species particularly vulnerable to extinction.

4. **Limited Genetic Diversity and Representation**: With only one population residing in a unique ecological niche and unknown genetic diversity, the beetle's ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions or genetic challenges is severely limited.

5. **Climate Change**: Although not directly mentioned as a current threat, the implications of climate change on regional groundwater recharge rates, freshwater ecosystems, and altered precipitation patterns could further compromise the beetle's habitat and survival probabilities.

6. **Potential and Current Conservation Efforts**: The management plan by KDWPT aims to mitigate many potential risks but may not sufficiently address the risk of groundwater discharge reduction due to regional water usage. 

To summarize, the primary threats to the viability of **Optioservus phaeus** include critical groundwater depletion, limited habitat protection against anthropogenic threats, inadequacy in redundancy and representation due to the species' highly restricted distribution, and unaddressed factors such as climate change that could exacerbate these vulnerabilities.",TRUE,NA,"3057SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/169759","Vaughn",3057,"Insecta","Optioservus phaeus","SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/169759","",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

1. **Habitat Degradation and Fragmentation**: 
   - This threat encompasses the ongoing degradation of suitable habitats for both D. aglaia and its host plant, Urera glabra. The fragmentation and alteration of these habitats are primarily due to human activities and the invasion of non-native species.

2. **Invasive Species**:
   - Feral ungulates such as pigs and goats, which cause destruction to the natural habitat of D. aglaia and its host plant through grazing and physical habitat alteration.
   - Non-native insect species like yellowjackets and tipulids, along with rats that may compete with or directly threaten D. aglaia through predation or habitat alteration.
   - Invasive plant species, particularly Psidium cattleianum and Clidemia hirta, which outcompete native species essential for D. aglaiaâ€™s survival. The spread of Melinis minutiflora, a highly flammable grass, increases the risk of wildfires that can destroy the forests D. aglaia calls home.

3. **Wildfires**:
   - Increased risk of wildfires, exacerbated by the presence and spread of invasive grass species like Melinis minutiflora, poses a significant threat to D. aglaiaâ€™s habitat. Fires can quickly destroy large areas of forest, particularly affecting species with limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements.

4. **Need for Management and Conservation Actions**:
   - There's a pressing need for effective management of lands designated as Critical Habitat and supports suitable habitat for D. aglaia. Such management should focus on control measures for feral ungulates and invasive plant species, as well as restoration efforts to enrich the habitat with a range of age classes of the host plant, Urera glabra.

1. **Lack of Access to Torreon Spring**: The inability to access the species' habitat due to it being located on private land without a cooperative agreement with the landowner jeopardizes the capacity to monitor and protect the species (Factor A, Factor D).

2. **Climate and Hydrologic Change**: Predictions of warmer temperatures and unpredictable precipitation patterns due to anthropogenic climate change may affect water temperature and availability in Torreon Spring, the sole habitat of the species. Changes in local hydrology could impact water flow and availability, critically affecting the snail's survival (Factor A, Factor E).

1. **Habitat Impacts Due to Land Use:** Land use changes, including agricultural activities, urban expansion, conversion of grassland/pasture to cropland, and possibly the lack of specific management for the species and the absence of new protected lands, have been identified as major risk factors affecting the species' habitat and population over time. These impacts are considered to lead to habitat loss or alteration which in turn affects the beetle's population size and distribution.

2. **Effects Related to Climate Change:** The assessment highlights potential scenarios under different climate change emissions scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) that predict significant impacts on the species' viability due to climatic conditions altering their habitat and the availability of resources such as appropriate carrion size for reproduction. It indicates that with moderate to high emissions scenarios, southern populations could be extirpated between 2040-2069, with northern populations potentially following by 2070-2099. Changes in temperature, climate conditions, and increased risk of droughts are specific concerns.

Other important factors, which while not the largest risks, are critical to consider and are directly or indirectly influenced by habitat alteration or climate change include:
- **Availability of appropriate-sized carrion for reproduction**
- **Soil moisture**, which can be affected by changes in climate and habitat alteration.
  
These threats collectively contribute to reduced resilience, redundancy, and representation of the species across its range, potentially leading to its further decline or extirpation in various areas. The viability of **Nicrophorus americanus** is considered very low under high emission climate change scenarios, with a significant portion of its range and populations at risk of being lost.",TRUE,NA,"66SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/165011","Ann Marie",66,"Insecta","Nicrophorus americanus","SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/165011","Mentioned many likely threats (all marked true), but decrease in prey and habitat modification were the major things",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

1. **Habitat Impacts due to Land Use Changes**: Changes in land use, such as agricultural expansion, urban development, and management practices, pose substantial threats to the American Burying Beetle's habitat. This includes both direct habitat destruction and fragmentation, which can isolate populations, reduce the availability of suitable carrion (their food source), and overall, decrease habitat quality necessary for their survival and reproduction.

2. **Climate Change Effects**: The impacts of climate change on the American Burying Beetle are identified as critical threats to its long-term viability. Climate change can exacerbate habitat loss and alter the conditions within their remaining habitats to the point they might no longer be viable for the species. Different climate change scenarios, including moderate and high emissions scenarios (represented by RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), forecast a range of impacts. The potential consequences include increased risk of extinction in certain areas, alterations in ecological dynamics that affect their carrion resources, indirect effects from changes in vegetation due to climate change, and increased vulnerability to extreme weather events like droughts.

These threats directly impact the three key parameters essential for the beetle's long-term viability: 
- **Resiliency** (the size and health of populations to withstand stochastic events),
- **Representation** (the genetic and ecological diversity necessary for the species to adapt over time),
- **Redundancy** (the number and distribution of populations across its range to withstand catastrophic events).

Both habitat changes due to land use and climate change can decrease the beetle's resiliency by making their environments uninhabitable or too fragmented to support viable populations. Additionally, these threats reduce the species' representation by limiting its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability. Finally, the reduction in redundancy means there are fewer populations distributed across the landscape, making the species more susceptible to extinction due to unpredictable events or localized extirpations.",TRUE,NA,"66SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/165011","Ann Marie",66,"Insecta","Nicrophorus americanus","SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/165011","Mentioned many likely threats (all marked true), but decrease in prey and habitat modification were the major things",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

1. **Habitat Destruction due to Private Development**: Initially considered the primary threat at the time of listing, the concern for habitat destruction has lessened somewhat due to most habitat now being on publicly protected lands. However, development remains a threat where habitat is privately owned.

2. **Habitat Degradation due to Public Infrastructure Projects**: Described as the most serious threat in the previous status review, the implication being that various construction or maintenance projects for public utilities or amenities could damage or destroy the butterfly's habitat.

3. **Habitat Loss due to Succession**: Natural ecological successions could lead to the habitat becoming unsuitable for the butterflies if the specific conditions they thrive in are altered.

4. **Poaching**: The illegal collection or harm to the butterflies could directly reduce their populations.

5. **Parasitism and Predation of Larvae**: Natural processes of parasitism and predation could impact larval survival rates and thus the population size.

6. **Small Population Size**: Having a small population can make the species more vulnerable to extinction due to genetic, environmental, and demographic stochasticities.

7. **Native and Exotic Plant Invasions**: The incursion of invasive plant species could alter the habitat's ecological balance, potentially making it less hospitable for the butterfly and its host plants.

8. **Climate Change**: Expected to have complex impacts on the butterfly's habitat, affecting the availability and condition of host and nectar plants, and may also alter the behavior and distribution of parasitoids and predators.

9. **Pesticide Use**: The application of pesticides could directly harm the butterflies or indirectly affect them by damaging their food sources or habitat.

10. **Accidental Damage During Population Monitoring**: The very efforts to monitor and protect the species could inadvertently damage the habitat and the species, suggesting a need for careful planning and execution of conservation activities.

The identified threats represent a combination of direct human impacts (such as habitat destruction and pesticide use), natural ecological processes (like parasitism, predation, and succession), and broader environmental challenges (including climate change and invasive species). Addressing these threats requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses habitat preservation and management, monitoring and research, and potentially mitigation measures for climate change and invasive species.",TRUE,NA,"3394ReviewURLshttps://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/956.pdf","Ann Marie",3394,"Insecta","Callophrys mossii bayensis","ReviewURLs","https://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/956.pdf","**How are pesticides categorized?

1. **Habitat Destruction and Modification:** The primary threat cited is habitat destruction through residential and commercial development. Historical land use for grazing and agriculture, as well as residential and urban development, significantly reduced the butterfly's range. Modification of habitat through weed control practices and invasion by non-native weeds are also threats to the butterfly's habitat.

2. **Lack of Regulatory Protection for Insects under Certain Laws:** The butterfly is not protected under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) as this act does not cover insects. While the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the Natural Communities Conservation Planning (NCCP) Act can provide some level of habitat consideration, these measures are not specifically mandated to protect insects like the Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly.

3. **Predation and Disease:** There is a concern about potential predation by earwigs on larval and egg stages of the butterfly during restoration efforts, although this is not currently considered a significant threat. The text does not indicate disease as a current major threat but acknowledges that neither disease nor predation is known to have substantial impacts at the time of review.

4. **Insufficient Recovery Measures in Existing Habitat:** Current habitats require management to control the spread of non-native weeds. There is mention of successful weed management programs but also an indication that historically impacted habitat will need restoration and planting of host plants for future recovery efforts.

5. **Potential Threats from Future Development:** Although measures have been taken to minimize the impact of development on known butterfly habitats, there is an acknowledgment that new development proposals could pose a threat, especially in areas not currently designated for conservation.

6. **Limited Habitat Availability for Reintroduction Efforts:** While there are large tracts of undeveloped land within the historical distribution of the butterfly that could potentially support its reintroduction following habitat restoration, the availability and suitability of these lands are contingent upon conservation efforts and plans that may or may not fully materialize.

7. **Limited Dispersal Ability of Adults:** Initial studies suggest that the butterfly's adults, especially females, may be relatively poor dispersers, which could impact the butterfly's ability to recolonize areas and maintain genetic diversity across patches of suitable habitat.

The ongoing conservation efforts, such as the captive breeding program and habitat restoration, are vital steps toward mitigating these threats.

Major contributing factors to this threat include:

1. **Industrial Activities and Urbanization**: The Antioch Dunes NWR is surrounded by industrial activities and urban development, which have historically degraded the dune habitat essential for the survival of Langeâ€™s metalmark butterfly. This includes pollution from nearby industrial activities and disturbance from recreational use and trespassing.

2. **Invasive Non-native Plant Species**: The invasion of non-native plants has significantly altered the dune ecosystem, competing with native plants for resources and altering the habitat. This poses a significant threat to the butterflyâ€™s survival since its host plant, the naked-stemmed buckwheat (Eriogonum nudum var. auriculum), is affected by these changes.

3. **Limited Habitat**: The butterfly is endemic to the Antioch Dunes, a very small and geographically isolated area. The restriction of its habitat to this small area makes the species especially vulnerable to extinction due to habitat destruction, alteration, and fragmentation.

4. **Sand Mining and Habitat Disturbance**: Past sand mining has significantly disturbed the dune habitat. Although the refuge was established to protect the remaining habitat, historical disturbances have likely contributed to the decline in butterfly population.

5. **Limited Genetic Diversity**: The populationâ€™s isolation and small size may lead to limited genetic diversity, making the species more susceptible to diseases and reducing its ability to adapt to environmental changes.

6. **Climate Change and Environmental Stochasticity**: As an additional inferred threat, climate change could further impact the butterflyâ€™s habitat by altering precipitation patterns and temperature, which in turn could affect the phenology and availability of its host and nectar plants.

While the text does not explicitly list climate change as a current threat, it is a relevant consideration for long-term conservation planning for any endangered species with highly restricted habitats.

The identified threats primarily relate to Listing Factor A (the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range) of the Endangered Species Act. Additionally, the impacts of invasive species, potential for disease and predation due to small population sizes, and possible inadequacies in existing regulatory mechanisms to fully protect the species and its habitat (Factors A, C, and D respectively) are implicit in the issues described. Lastly, the specific environment requirements and limited distribution of Apodemia mormo langei inherently increase its vulnerability, falling under Factor E (other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence).",TRUE,NA,"4382ReviewURLshttps://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/1250.pdf","Ann Marie",4382,"Insecta","Apodemia mormo langei","ReviewURLs","https://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/1250.pdf","**Herbicides (on host plants) considered threat, marked under """"pollution",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

Like other site-specific and range-restricted species, the distal-gland springsnail exhibits high site fidelity and resilience at occupied locations, particularly where habitat restoration and protections are enforced, such as on the Refuge. However, the loss of one historical population indicates some vulnerability to environmental and anthropogenic changes, impacting overall species resilience and redundancy.

The three current springs represent moderate redundancy for the species, though geographic proximity limits effective demographic independence between populations. Despite some level of habitat restoration and protection within the Refuge, the small number and close proximity of populations limit the species' overall representation and adaptability to large-scale environmental changes.

Given the narrow range and specific habitat requirements, the distal-gland springsnail's viability is likely moderate, assuming current conditions persist. However, the species' small number of populations and limited distribution make it particularly susceptible to future threats that could reduce springflow or alter habitat conditions significantly. Scenario 2, involving slight to moderate reductions in springflow, could potentially impact the species by further reducing habitat availability or quality, particularly at smaller springs, leading to a reduction in species resilience. Scenario 3, with extreme reductions in springflow, poses a substantial risk to the distal-gland springsnail's viability, potentially leading to further population declines or extirpations due to the direct loss of aquatic habitat and the cascading effects on water quality, aquatic vegetation, and substrate.

In summary, the identified threats for the Pyrgulopsis erythropoma and related springsnail species include predation and competition, vegetation and soil disturbance, water pollution, and spring modifications, with the overarching concerns of groundwater pumping and climate change-induced alterations in precipitation patterns posing significant risks to future conditions.

1. **Water Quality Degradation**: The text indicates a significant issue with declining water quality within the Snake River habitat, primarily due to development, pollution, and agricultural runoff. For aquatic species like Taylorconcha serpenticola, whose survival depends on clean, cold, well-oxygenated water, any deterioration in water quality can pose a direct threat to their existence.

2. **Habitat Fragmentation and Loss**: The construction of reservoirs (e.g., C.J. Strike Reservoir, American Falls Dam) and other developments along the Snake River have altered the natural flow of the river, leading to habitat fragmentation. For Taylorconcha serpenticola, which relies on specific habitat conditions found in free-flowing reaches or cold-water spring alcoves, such alterations can limit available habitat and disrupt key ecological processes.

3. **Aquifer Decline**: The plan emphasizes the importance of stabilizing the Snake River Plain aquifer to maintain discharge levels critical for conserving cold-water spring habitats vital for the survival of Taylorconcha serpenticola and other listed snails. Declines in aquifer levels can reduce spring flow, affecting habitat quality and availability.

4. **Non-Native Species**: Although not detailed extensively in the provided text, the action point on evaluating the effects of non-native flora and fauna implies that the introduction and spread of invasive species may also pose a threat to native aquatic species by competing for resources, predation, or habitat alteration.

5. **Development and Pollution**: There's mention of the need to protect cold-water spring habitats from further degradation due to human activities like diversions for agriculture, urban development, and pollution. These activities can lead to direct habitat destruction or changes in water quality and quantity, making the habitat unsuitable for Taylorconcha serpenticola.

6. **Water Temperature Changes**: The shift from a primarily free-flowing, cold-water system to a slower-moving, warmer system affects species like Taylorconcha serpenticola that are adapted to cold water environments. Warmer water temperatures can stress these organisms, leading to potential declines in population.

Addressing these threats involves a combination of habitat protection and restoration, maintaining stringent water quality standards, and managing aquifer levels to ensure the survival and recovery of Taylorconcha serpenticola and other endangered or threatened aquatic species in the Snake River ecosystem.",TRUE,NA,"4780RecoveryPlanURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/951126.pdf","Ann Marie",4780,"Gastropoda","Taylorconcha serpenticola","RecoveryPlanURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/951126.pdf","**Does agricultural pollution qualify both agriculture and pollution as threats?",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Here's a summary based on the extensive review information provided:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Modification (Factor A):** This is identified as a significant threat, particularly from agricultural conversion and urban development, which impacts the fragile vernal pool ecosystems required by the Longhorn Fairy Shrimp. Although a significant portion of known populations is protected on public lands, which mitigates this threat to some extent, ongoing concerns about habitat loss outside these protected areas remain.

2. **Inefficacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms (Factor D):** While some regulations exist to protect this species and its habitat, including the designation of critical habitat and protection under the Endangered Species Act, the adequacy of these measures in the face of ongoing and potential future threats is a concern. The success of regulatory mechanisms relies on their proper implementation and enforcement, areas where challenges persist.

3. **Inadequate Habitat Protection and Management:** Although substantial efforts have been made to protect habitat within identified core recovery areas, there is an acknowledged need for more protections, especially in terms of habitat management and monitoring plans. The recovery plan calls for a significant portion of suitable habitat to be protected, and for populations to be protected across their geographic and genetic ranges, but acknowledges that these goals have not yet been fully achieved.

4. **Lack of Comprehensive Habitat and Species Monitoring:** There is a noted lack of a consistent, comprehensive program for monitoring the hydrology essential for vernal pool ecosystem function and the status of the Longhorn Fairy Shrimp populations. This gap hinders the ability to assess the effectiveness of habitat protection and management efforts, and to understand the species' status fully.

5. **Threats from Environmental Disturbances:** Threats such as increased risk of extirpation from stochastic events (including severe droughts), degradation of habitat by invasive plant species, inappropriate grazing practices, and other unforeseen environmental disturbances are noted. These threats can impact isolated populations, even within protected areas, and undermine conservation efforts.

6. **Need for Adaptive Habitat Management:** The need for effective habitat management and monitoring plans that can adapt to changing conditions and ensure the maintenance of ecosystem function and species viability is highlighted as a critical area for ongoing and future focus.

7. **Research Gaps:** There is an acknowledgment of essential unanswered research questions that need to be addressed to inform recovery efforts effectively. This includes research into the species' biology, habitat requirements, genetic diversity, and responses to environmental changes.

In summary, the primary threats to the Longhorn Fairy Shrimp revolve around habitat protection and management, with ongoing challenges related to ensuring adequate regulatory protections, addressing environmental disturbances, filling research gaps, and establishing comprehensive monitoring programs.",TRUE,NA,"4294ReviewURLshttps://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/1116.pdf","Vaughn",4294,"Branchiopoda","Branchinecta longiantenna","ReviewURLs","https://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/1116.pdf","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here are the specific threats identified from the information given:

1. **Development and Urbanization:** The main threat highlighted is habitat loss due to development and urbanization. The text notes that approximately 28 occupied vernal pool complexes of the total 137 have been partially lost due to development, and three complexes are known to have been permanently lost to development since the listing. This reflects the pressure from construction, housing developments, and other forms of economic activities that directly impact the species by destroying or altering their habitat.

2. **Disturbance and Fragmentation:** The habitats of *B. sandiegonensis* are further threatened by disturbance and fragmentation resulting from urban sprawl, agriculture, and road construction. These processes not only reduce the size of habitat patches but also isolate populations, making it difficult for genetic exchange and dispersal among vernal pool complexes.

3. **Introduction of Non-native Species:** Another threat to *B. sandiegonensis* and its ecosystem is the introduction of non-native species, leading to competition for resources or predation. Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, this is a common threat to many native species.

4. **Pollution:** Pollution from agricultural run-off, pesticides, and urban pollutants could impact the water quality of vernal pools, affecting the health and reproduction of fairy shrimp populations.

5. **Human-induced Genetic Homogenization:** The text discusses a study indicating that human activities may homogenize the genetic composition of *B. sandiegonensis* populations across different pools, potentially reducing the species' overall genetic diversity and adaptability.

6. **Climate Change:** While not directly mentioned, the implications of climate change, such as altered precipitation patterns and temperature changes, could significantly affect vernal pool hydrology and the availability of suitable habitats.

7. **Fire:** The impact of fire on vernal pool ecosystems and *B. sandiegonensis* is mentioned as being studied. While initial findings from a specific study indicated no apparent negative effects, the long-term impact of increased wildfire frequency and intensity, a consequence of climate change, could pose additional stress on these habitats.

1. **Habitat Destruction and Loss**: This threat encompasses several activities that lead to the destruction or significant alteration of the habitat necessary for the survival of Trimerotropis infantilis. Key activities include:
   - **Sand Mining**: Historically considered a primary threat due to large-scale operations in the Zayante sandhills. Although reduced, there are still active quarries that, along with past activities, cause habitat fragmentation and degradation.
   - **Urban Development**: Previously a primary threat, the rate has slowed down, but the effects of developed lands (e.g., habitat fragmentation) continue to impact the species.
   - **Recreational Use of Habitat**: Includes activities like hiking, biking, equestrian use, and """"sandboarding,"""" which can remove vegetation cover, cause erosion, and preclude recolonization of plants, thereby impacting the habitat of Trimerotropis infantilis.

2. **Altered Fire Regimes/Forest or Chaparral Succession**: Fire suppression or exclusion in a fire-adapted ecosystem allows for the colonization by pioneering native and non-native species and promotes the dominance of later-successional shrubs and trees. This reduces the open canopy and availability of exposed sandy soil vital for the Zayante band-winged grasshopper's egg-laying and potentially affects the burrowing activities necessary for their lifecycle.

3. **Agricultural Conversion**: The conversion of sandhills habitat into agricultural land, especially for vineyards, although not currently occurring at significant levels, is still considered a threat to the species' habitat.

4. **Climate Change**: Predictions of increased temperatures, extreme storms, drought, and wildfire due to climate change can have unpredictable but likely negative effects on Trimerotropis infantilis by altering their habitat, affecting food resources, and increasing susceptibility to desiccation and competition from non-native species.

It's important to note that while some threats such as overcollection and pesticides were considered in the past, they are not currently seen as significant threats to Trimerotropis infantilis based on the review.

1. **Habitat Loss or Degradation**: More than 90% of anchialine pool habitats have been lost or degraded due to anthropogenic activities, particularly coastal development. This reduction in habitable areas severely limits the available space for the shrimp to thrive and reproduce.

2. **Introduction of Non-native Species**: The spread of exotic species into the anchialine pool habitats can lead to increased competition for resources or direct predation on Vetericaris chaceorum. 

3. **Limited Geographical Distribution and Isolation**: The species has been documented in a very small number of locations, which may lead to inbreeding and reduce genetic diversity. This limited distribution also makes the species more vulnerable to localized threats.

4. **Environmental Requirements**: Vetericaris chaceorum has specific needs regarding salinity and perhaps temperature that restrict its presence to certain anchialine pools. Any changes to the water chemistry or temperature of these habitats could negatively impact the species.

5. **Difficulty in Detections and Low Observed Numbers**: The cryptic nature of this species, combined with challenges in sampling large anchialine pools, complicates efforts to accurately assess population size and trends.

When considering areas that may require special management or protection, factors such as the need for management activities to remove or control invasive species, or the need to implement measures to reduce the risk or impact of human-induced threats like wildfire or recreational pressures are taken into account. The special management needs or protections may also include actions to ameliorate habitat fragmentation, which can imperil the long-term viability of species by isolating populations or reducing gene flow. Further, management considerations could involve restoring or enhancing the habitat to support the essential life-history needs of the species, or to increase connectivity between habitat areas to facilitate species movement, dispersal, and genetic exchange.

To identify critical habitat, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) follows an evidence-based process, engaging in a review of the best available scientific and commercial data including information from peer-reviewed literature, State and Federal agencies, Native Hawaiian organizations, and other knowledgeable sources. Critical habitat designations are made using GIS data and careful evaluation of both occupied and unoccupied habitats to determine the areas that exhibit features essential to the conservation of the species.

Critical habitat designations, while providing a science-based tool to aid in the conservation of endangered and threatened species, do not themselves establish reserves or directly change land use. Rather, they require Federal agencies to ensure actions they approve or fund do not adversely modify designated critical habitats. It's through consultation with the USFWS and the implementation of measures that avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse modifications to critical habitats that tangible conservation benefits are realized. Such designations provide an important regulatory mechanism to promote conservation and recovery of endangered and threatened species by preserving the habitat features vital to their survival and recovery.",TRUE,NA,"5665CriticalHabitatDesignationURLshttps://www.govinfo.gov/link/fr/88/18756","Ann Marie",5665,"Malacostraca","Vetericaris chaceorum","CriticalHabitatDesignationURLs","https://www.govinfo.gov/link/fr/88/18756","Designation of critical habitat denied for this species because disclosing locations would not be prudent.

1. **Habitat Destruction and Degradation**: This encompasses the complete removal of native prairie habitat and its replacement with row-crop agriculture. It also includes habitat degradation due to recurring intensive livestock grazing and invasion by non-native plant species.

2. **Unsustainable Mortality from Management Practices**: This includes mortality caused by prescribed fires and insecticide use, which is suggested as unsustainable for the species.

3. **Fragmentation of Populations**: Historically, Dakota skipper populations were more continuous but are now fragmented among discrete remnants of native tall grass and mixed-grass prairie. This fragmentation is primarily due to habitat loss and plays a significant role in the species' decline by isolating populations and decreasing genetic diversity and resilience.

4. **Climate Change**: Although the SSA indicates that the current and future vulnerability of Dakota skipper populations to climate change was not fully assessed within the document, it mentions the potential threat of novel environmental changes such as shifts to wetter and warmer conditions across the species' range. These conditions could increase the threat posed by invasive cool-season grasses.

5. **Decrease in Resiliency, Redundancy, and Representation**: The document outlines how the number, health, and distribution of Dakota skipper populations have and are expected to continue declining, thus reducing the species' ability to withstand normal environmental variation, catastrophes, and adapt to new changes such as diseases and climate change.

6. **Reduction in Adaptive Genetic Diversity**: The decrease in population sizes and the extirpation of populations from parts of its range reduces the species' overall genetic diversity. This reduction in genetic diversity diminishes the species' potential for adaptation to environmental changes or novel threats.

7. **Prescribed Management Practices**: Specific management practices such as burning, haying, and grazing regimes, along with pesticide use, were identified as influential factors on the viability of Dakota skipper populations. These practices can negatively impact the quality of habitat and the survivability of populations if not applied in a manner that considers the needs of the Dakota skipper.

8. **Loss of Populations and Metapopulation Dynamics**: Significant portions of metapopulations, with metapopulation dynamics being crucial for species survival, have been lost. This loss has contributed to the decline in the species' overall viability.

3. Inappropriate Vegetation Management: The need for proper vegetation management on public land to protect and maintain the defined skipper habitat suggests that poor management practices or changes in vegetation could threaten the species.

4. Limited Distribution: The Pawnee montane skipper occurs only on the Pikes Peak Granite Formation in Colorado. This limited distribution makes the species more vulnerable to localized threats, including environmental changes, development, or severe weather events.

5. Dependency on Specific Plants: The life history/ecology section underlines the skipperâ€™s dependence on specific plant species for nectar (primarily prairie gayfeather) and larval food (blue grama grass). Any threat to these plants directly affects the skipper's survival.

6. Possible Effects of Fire and Logging: Though the prairie gayfeather requires openings from single event disturbances such as logging or fire-created habitat, the skipper does not colonize these areas immediately after such disturbances, indicating potential negative impacts on its population from these activities.

7. Threats to Nectar Sources: While prairie gayfeather is the most important nectar source, other occasional sources include musk thistle, classified as a noxious weed. If actions are taken to eradicate such """"noxious weeds,"""" it could inadvertently harm the skipperâ€™s population by removing critical nectar sources.

These threats highlight the fragile balance required in managing the habitat and ecosystem for the survival of Hesperia leonardus montana.

1. Habitat loss and fragmentation:
   - The text mentions that habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation due to agriculture, urban, and suburban development impact the species by reducing the availability and connectivity of diverse and abundant floral resources. This affects the bees' ability to find suitable nesting, mating, overwintering habitats, and ultimately the genetic health of the species.

2. Pesticide use:
   - The use of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides can have direct and indirect effects on the Yellow Banded Bumble Bee and its habitat. Some pesticides are acutely toxic to bumble bees, further endangering their populations.

3. Pathogens and parasites:
   - Increased use of managed bees has led to a rise in native and non-native pathogens and parasites within both managed and native bee populations. This can reduce the fitness of colonies and cause mortality to individuals and colonies.

4. Small and isolated populations:
   - Yellow Banded Bumble Bee populations that are small and/or isolated are at risk of having reduced genetic flow, lesser genetic diversity from inbreeding, and genetic drift. This is exacerbated by environmental stressors, making them more vulnerable to extinction.

5. The effects of climate change:
   - Changes in climate can directly affect individual bees or disrupt the colony life cycle, such as timing of emergence and overwintering, survival during hibernation, and timing of mating and colony production. Climate change may also limit the species' ability to adapt due to reduced genetic diversity.

6. Competition and the effects of scientific collection are mentioned but not detailed as primary concerns.

7. Synergistic effects of multiple stressors:
   - The impact of habitat changes due to human activity, pesticide use, climate change, disease, and other stressors may act synergistically, amplifying the negative effects on the Yellow Banded Bumble Bee populations.

Under the future scenarios outlined, the Yellow Banded Bumble Bee's viability, representation, and redundancy are all expected to decline under most conditions, with the historical and current survey data suggesting that the species' range will continue to contract, particularly along the already receding southern boundary.

1. **Loss of Habitat:** Much of the historical coastal and lowland dry forest habitats where the species was known to exist has either been developed or degraded and is no longer suitable for *Hylaeus assimulans*. The native-dominated habitats that remain are highly fragmented throughout the bee's historical range. This loss and fragmentation of habitat are substantial threats to the survival of the species.

2. **Invasive Species:** The encroachment of invasive plant species in the native habitats can alter the ecological balance and decrease the availability of native plants that *Hylaeus assimulans* relies on for food sources such as nectar and pollen. The canopy in some of the bee's habitats has been dominated by invasive trees like kiawe, reducing the presence of native undergrowth crucial for the bee's survival.

3. **Limited Population Size and Isolation:** The species is known from only a few small patches of suitable habitat, leading to limited population sizes and isolation of populations from each other. This increases vulnerability to genetic drift, inbreeding, and reduced genetic variation, which can impact the resilience of populations to environmental changes and catastrophic events.

4. **Climate Change and Environmental Variability:** The variability in weather patterns and climate change can exacerbate drought conditions, affecting the availability of flowers for nectar and pollen. Since *Hylaeus assimulans* relies on specific native plants for survival, changes in climate can severely impact their ability to find food and suitable nesting sites.

5. **Anthropogenic Impacts:** Human activities such as development, agriculture, and recreational use of land can directly destroy or degrade the habitats of *Hylaeus assimulans*. Additionally, pollution, pesticide use, and other chemical-related threats from human activities can indirectly affect the populations by contaminating the plants they rely on for food.

These factors combined contribute to the vulnerability of *Hylaeus assimulans* populations to extinction, with the quality of remaining habitat being at risk from both environmental and anthropogenic related threats.

Here's a summary of threats based on the provided recovery plan excerpt:

1. **Habitat Destruction**: The primary threat to Cicurina madla is the destruction of its karst habitat, which can occur through several different mechanisms, including:
   - Filling caves with cement during development projects.
   - Quarrying activities that obliterate karst features.
   - Capping or sealing cave entrances, which can alter the internal environment of the caves.

2. **Alteration of Drainage Patterns**: Development and other land use changes can alter the natural water drainage patterns that are crucial for maintaining the cave ecosystems that Cicurina madla depends on.

3. **Alteration of Surface Plant and Animal Communities**: Changes to the surface environment, such as the destruction of native vegetation or the introduction of non-native species, can affect the flow of nutrients into the cave systems, impacting the food sources for Cicurina madla.

4. **Edge Effects**: The fragmentation of habitats can lead to """"edge effects,"""" where the conditions at the edge of a habitat patch differ significantly from the interior, potentially negatively affecting species that rely on interior conditions.

5. **Contamination**: Pollution from surface activities can seep into the karst systems, contaminating the habitat of Cicurina madla with potentially toxic substances.

6. **Human Visitation and Vandalism**: Excessive or irresponsible human visitation can physically damage cave ecosystems, disturb the species within, and introduce pollutants.

7. **Quarrying and Mining Operations**: These activities directly destroy karst features and can also lead to contamination and altered drainage patterns.

8. **Competition and Predation by Red Imported Fire Ants**: These invasive ants can outcompete native species that Cicurina madla might rely on for food and can also directly predate on the spiders themselves.

9. **Climate Change**: Alterations in temperature and precipitation patterns due to climate change can impact the delicate balance of cave ecosystems on which Cicurina madla relies.

10. **Small Population Size**: The small and fragmented populations of Cicurina madla are more vulnerable to extinction from stochastic events and genetic problems associated with small population sizes.

To combat these threats and move towards recovery of Cicurina madla, the plan identifies a multifaceted strategy that includes habitat protection and management, monitoring, research, and adaptive management practices. Key actions involve legal protection for significant karst areas, ongoing research to better understand the species and its needs, and educational efforts to promote conservation.",TRUE,NA,"2467RecoveryPlanURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/Final 2001 Bexar Co Invertebrates Rec Plan_1.pdf","Vaughn",2467,"Euchelicerata","Cicurina madla","RecoveryPlanURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/Final 2001 Bexar Co Invertebrates Rec Plan_1.pdf","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This cave-dwelling, troglobitic spider species faces threats primarily from urban development, which leads to habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. Additional threats include changes in moisture availability, temperature stability, predation or competition from invasive species like the red-imported fire ant, nutrient input alterations affecting the cave ecosystem, disturbance to mesocavern systems that support karst invertebrate populations, and potential impacts from catastrophic events such as contamination or flooding.

Key points related to threats include:
- The **restricted range** and **specific habitat requirements** (high humidity and stable temperatures within subterranean voids) make the species vulnerable to changes in external conditions. Urban development directly removes habitat areas and may disrupt the delicate subterranean ecosystems upon which this spider depends.
- **Urban development** can result in the **loss of surface and subsurface karst features** and **alteration of drainage patterns**, impacting the availability of moisture and nutrients essential for the survival of Cicurina madla and its prey.
- The presence and expansion of **invasive species** such as the red-imported fire ant (RIFA) pose a threat through predation and competition.
- **Disruption of nutrient flow** from the surface to underground ecosystems can affect the food web within caves. Since the majority of nutrients in subterranean ecosystems originate from surface habitats, any alteration in the surrounding plant communities due to development or pollution can impact nutrient availability and, consequently, the cave ecosystem.
- **Habitat fragmentation** may limit gene flow between populations and reduce the species' capacity to recover from stochastic events or adapt to changing environmental conditions.
- The **limited number of known locations** (known from only six caves at the time of the speciesâ€™ listing) exacerbates its vulnerability to extinction due to localized disturbances or catastrophic events.

Effective conservation for the Madla Cave Meshweaver necessitates a focus on protecting significant habitat areas, known as Karst Fauna Areas (KFAs), to preserve the species' genetic diversity, adaptability, and resilience. This involves perpetual preservation and management of these habitats, which includes maintaining suitable moisture levels, temperature conditions, nutrient inputs, and protection from invasive species and human-induced threats. Furthermore, ensuring the integrity and connectivity of these habitat areas is crucial for fostering a stable environment that supports not only Cicurina madla but the broader karst ecosystem upon which it depends.",TRUE,NA,"2467ReviewURLshttps://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/2809.pdf","Vaughn",2467,"Euchelicerata","Cicurina madla","ReviewURLs","https://ecosphere-documents-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/sams/public_docs/species_nonpublish/2809.pdf","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

1. **Habitat Destruction and Loss**: This threat encompasses several factors, including sand mining and urban development. While sand mining has decreased, the residual effects of past mining activities have led to habitat fragmentation and degradation, rendering some areas unsuitable for the Mount Hermon June beetle and the Zayante band-winged grasshopper.
   
2. **Altered Fire Regimes**: Fire suppression or exclusion in fire-adapted ecosystems leads to changes in vegetation that can affect the availability of sandy soil habitats required for the species. Altered fire regimes contribute to habitat changes that may not support Mount Hermon June beetle populations as they used to.

3. **Recreational Use of Habitat**: Activities such as hiking, biking, equestrian use, and """"sandboarding"""" can damage the physical structure of the habitat, removing plant cover and causing erosion. This impacts the ability of the Mount Hermon June beetle to utilize these areas.

4. **Agricultural Conversion**: While not as significant as other threats, the conversion of natural sandhill habitats to agricultural uses, notably vineyards, poses a risk by removing potential habitat areas.

5. **Climate Change**: Projected changes in the climate, including increases in temperature and variability in precipitation, present unpredictable impacts on the habitats of the Mount Hermon June beetle. These climatic changes could lead to alterations in the beetle's lifecycle, food availability, habitat suitability, and the overall ecosystem health of the sandhills.

6. **Predation**: While large-scale predation is not seen as a significant threat, instances of predation by bats on the Mount Hermon June beetle have been observed or suspected. This natural predation could potentially impact population levels, especially if other threats have already made the populations vulnerable.

7. **Collection, Pesticides, and Disease**: Though previously considered potential threats or unclear in their impact, the text suggests collection and pesticide use are unlikely to currently pose significant direct threats to the species. Disease and large-scale predation are also not identified as current threats, although predation by specific predators, such as bats, is noted.

1. **High levels of pedestrian traffic:** This is particularly damaging at the larval stage of the beetle's life cycle. Since larvae live in vertical burrows generally in the beach intertidal zone, excessive foot traffic can crush these structures, leading to high mortality rates.

2. **ORVs (Off-Road Vehicles):** The use of off-road vehicles on beaches can disrupt the habitat by crushing larvae and adults, disrupting the substrate, and thus, significantly damaging populations.

3. **Coastal development:** Development along the coastline can lead to habitat loss or fragmentation, reducing the available space for these beetles to live and breed. Beachfront constructions often inhibit natural processes and alter the habitat in ways that are not conducive to the survival of beach-dwelling species like the northeastern beach tiger beetle.

4. **Beach stabilization structures:** While these structures, such as sea walls and groynes, are meant to prevent erosion, they can also alter the natural dynamics of beach habitats. Such alterations can negatively impact the populations of northeastern beach tiger beetles by changing the environment in ways that do not support their lifecycle.

5. **Lack of undisturbed beaches:** The beetle requires undisturbed habitats for successful breeding and larval development. The availability of such habitats has been significantly reduced due to human activities, leaving only a few suitable locations where the beetle can thrive.

6. **Lack of nearby populations for colonization:** For a population to remain genetically healthy and have good chances of recovery and expansion, there needs to be an exchange between populations.

2. Climate change impacts on specialized habitat at the edge of streams, making E. newcombi very susceptible to increases in the frequency and duration of drier periods, as well as more intense flooding events which can displace native plant species with invasive ones.

3. Invasive plant species widespread across the sub-population locations of E. newcombi, posing a considerable threat to their habitat.

4. Non-native lymnaeids (another type of freshwater snail), flatworms, and other parasites represent an understudied threat to E. newcombi.

5. Predation and habitat degradation by goats (Capra hircus), rats (Rattus spp.), marsh flies, pigs (Sus scrofa), and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana).

The review also reiterated other threats monitoring and control recommendations, including research into population biology, predator/herbivore monitoring and control, instream flow protection, surveys and inventories, and specific threats such as predatory snail Euglandina rosea. The continued absence of consistent monitoring and survey efforts and the presence of invasive species not previously considered threats were highlighted as concerns.

1. **Altered Hydrology:** The alteration of natural water flows due to human activities poses a significant threat to the habitat of Newcomb's Snail. This includes:
   - Agricultural development and stream diversion causing loss of habitat.
   - Dewatering aquifers resulting in the loss of habitat.
   - The creation of vertical wells leading to habitat loss.
   - Channelization of waterways causing loss or degradation of habitat.
   - Hydroelectric power projects resulting in the loss or degradation of habitat.

2. **Landslides and Flooding:** Natural disasters such as landslides and flooding can lead to the loss or degradation of habitat for Newcomb's Snail, affecting its survival and reproduction.

3. **Stochastic Events:** Stochastic (random and unpredictable) events such as hurricane-induced mortality and reduced viability present threats to the snail's population. Hurricanes can cause direct damage to their habitat and indirectly affect their survival by altering their habitat conditions.

The review emphasizes that these threats result in the degradation and loss of habitat, loss of life due to smothering from soil or other debris picked up by the waterway or upslope, and that despite existing knowledge, no significant new information has been collected that would change the Federal listing status of Newcomb's Snail from endangered.

"81",862,8977,"Gastropoda","Pyrgulopsis anguina","SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/189457","Given the extensive information provided, the following key threats to Pyrgulopsis anguina, the longitudinal gland pyrg, have been identified:

1. **Predation and Competition**: The species faces threats from predation and competition, possibly from invasive species and other native fauna that might outcompete it for resources.

2. **Spring Modification**: Modifications to springs, such as surface water diversion, channel modification, and groundwater pumping, are significant threats. These alterations can lead to habitat degradation and loss, which directly impacts Pyrgulopsis anguina populations.

3. **Vegetation and Soil Disturbance**: This can result from multiple sources, including grazing and road construction or maintenance. Such disturbances can affect spring water quality and substrate, crucial for Pyrgulopsis anguina's survival.

4. **Water Pollution**: Although not explicitly mentioned for Pyrgulopsis anguina, water pollution is a common stressor for aquatic species, affecting water quality and potentially the health and viability of spring snail populations.

5. **Climate Change and Altered Precipitation/Temperature**: Changes in precipitation patterns and temperature could affect spring discharge rates and water quality, posing a long-term threat to the species by altering its habitat.

6. **Groundwater Pumping and Withdrawals**: Future conditions suggest groundwater pumping and withdrawals as a major concern, likely reducing spring flow or discharge, crucial for the species' habitat.

7. **Reduced Representation and Redundancy**: Given the small number of locations where Pyrgulopsis anguina is found, any significant change in one site can have severe consequences for the overall population, thus reducing redundancy (the speciesâ€™ ability to withstand catastrophic events) and representation (genetic diversity and environmental variation within the species).

8. **Limited Genetic Diversity**: The longitudinal gland pyrg occurs in only a few locations, potentially limiting its genetic diversity. This limited diversity could make the species less adaptable to changing conditions or new threats.

The future scenarios considered in the assessment suggest that scenario 2, a reduction in spring flow or discharge, is the most likely to occur and the one that may pose significant risks to the species' resilience, redundancy, and representation. Successful adaptation to these threats requires maintaining or enhancing the speciesâ€™ resilience through habitat protection and management actions that safeguard water quality, spring discharge, and other critical habitat characteristics.",TRUE,TRUE,"8977SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/189457","Vaughn",8977,"Gastropoda","Pyrgulopsis anguina","SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/189457","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

1. **Spring Modifications and Water Diversion:** Impacts from surface water diversion, impoundments, and channel modifications. These activities have historically altered the natural flow and habitat of springs where the White River Valley pyrg resides. Although many of these conditions have since stabilized, they represent a past threat that has contributed to the species' current status.

2. **Vegetation and Soil Disturbance:** Disturbances from recreation and grazing by ungulates have historically impacted the springs and spring provinces. These disturbances can lead to habitat degradation affecting the quality of water and substrate necessary for the survival of Pyrgulopsis sathos.

3. **Groundwater Pumping:** There is uncertainty regarding future increases in groundwater pumping. If new water right applications are approved or if projects like the SNWA (Southern Nevada Water Authority) groundwater project are built, they could significantly affect the discharge of springs. Groundwater withdrawal directly impacts the availability and quality of water for the species, potentially reducing habitat suitability and population resiliency.

4. **Climate Change:** Expected to result in increased temperatures and decreased precipitation in the range of White River Valley pyrg over the next 50 years. These changes can lead to reduced spring flow and discharge, further stressing the populations.

Considering the above threats, the report outlines a possible decrease in discharge under scenario 2, which would variably impact the resiliency of White River Valley pyrg's populations based on habitat extents, the current size of populations, and their ability to persist after disturbances. Despite these challenges, under scenario 2, the expectation is for 4 populations to retain moderate to high resiliency.",TRUE,TRUE,"8996SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/133012","Ann Marie",8996,"Gastropoda","Pyrgulopsis sathos","SpeciesStatusAssessmentURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/133012","",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

1. Impoundments: The construction of dams in the Tennessee River system has led to the loss of many populations of Anthony's riversnail. These impoundments have altered the river's flow and habitat, causing fragmentation and isolation of remaining populations, making them more susceptible to other environmental impacts and extirpation.

2. Deterioration of Water and Substrata Quality: Factors such as inadequate erosion and sedimentation control from mining, agricultural, timbering, and construction activities; run-off and discharge of organic and inorganic pollutants from industrial, municipal, agricultural, and other sources; and habitat alterations associated with channelization and dredging activities have contributed to the loss of populations and continue to threaten the two surviving populations.

3. Habitat Fragmentation and Isolation: The populations have become isolated due to impoundments, which makes natural recolonization of habitats unlikely without human intervention. This isolation also makes populations vulnerable to local extirpation from catastrophic events.

4. Single Catastrophic Events: Because the remaining populations are located in short stretches of river, they are particularly vulnerable to being wiped out by a single event, such as a toxic chemical spill or a major river channel/habitat modification.

5. Disease, Parasites, and Predation: While specific diseases have not been identified, like other mollusks, Anthony's riversnail may suffer from parasite infestations that could affect reproduction and population dynamics. Additionally, predation by various natural predators could limit the recovery or contribute to the local extirpation of already depleted populations.",TRUE,TRUE,"4827RecoveryPlanURLshttps://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/970813.pdf","Vaughn",4827,"Gastropoda","Athearnia anthonyi","RecoveryPlanURLs","https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/970813.pdf","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

1. **Invasion by the Woodland Crayfish (Faxonius hylas):** The introduction and expansion of the non-native Woodland Crayfish into habitats occupied by Faxonius quadruncus poses a significant threat. The Woodland Crayfish, believed to be introduced through bait bucket releases, competes with native crayfish species and has been documented to reduce their abundance significantly. There's evidence that in areas where the Woodland Crayfish invades, the abundance of native crayfish like Faxonius quadruncus is substantially reduced, and in some cases, native species are completely displaced. This displacement may be due to mechanisms such as reproductive interference or hybridization.

2. **Heavy Metal Contamination:** Heavy metal contamination, stemming from historical lead mining activities in southeastern Missouri, poses a threat to Faxonius quadruncus. Metals and mining-related tailings adversely affect crayfish by altering their ecological functions and health. Studies in areas affected by mining activities have shown that heavy metal contamination can significantly impact riffle-dwelling crayfish, reducing their densities and survivorship. These metals, accumulated in the environment, continue to affect aquatic biota, including crayfish, years after mining has ceased.

3. **Sedimentation:** Excessive sedimentation in the Upper St. Francis River watershed, partly due to historical mining and erosion, can adversely affect Faxonius quadruncus. Sedimentation covers rocks and cavities that crayfish use for refuge, which are essential for their survival. The deposited fine sediment from tailings or other sources can significantly reduce the available habitat and carrying capacity for crayfish populations, potentially increasing their vulnerability to predation and competition with invasive species like the Woodland Crayfish.

1. **Water Quality and Habitat Degradation**: The primary threats to the Tar River Spinymussel are related to water quality issues and habitat degradation resulting from siltation, agricultural runoffs, and municipal/industrial discharges. These factors contribute to the loss or decline of suitable habitats for the mussel, affecting its survival and reproduction.

2. **Fragmented and Relict Distribution**: The mussel's population is described as having a very fragmented and relict distribution. Such fragmentation and isolation of sub-populations can limit genetic exchange and reduce the resilience of the population to environmental changes or stochastic events.

3. **Extremely Low Population Levels and Limited Reproductive Success**: The existing sub-populations are extremely small in numbers, and there is evidence suggesting very low levels of successful reproduction. This is critical as low population sizes and reduced genetic diversity can lead to a decrease in the species' adaptability and resilience to environmental changes.

4. **Potential Extirpation of Sub-populations**: There is a concern that the mainstem Tar River, Chicod Creek, and the mainstem Neuse River sub-populations may be extirpated (locally extinct), with additional surveys needed to confirm their status. The loss of these sub-populations could further decrease the species' overall genetic diversity and resilience.

5. **Land Use Activities**: Existing and likely future land use activities pose a significant and increasing threat of extinction for the remaining populations. Such activities likely contribute to habitat destruction and modification, further exacerbating the species' vulnerability.

6. **Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms**: The text mentions inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms as a contributing factor to the species' continued endangered status. This points to a need for stronger or more effective regulatory measures to protect the mussel and its habitat from ongoing threats.

7. **Effects of Severe Weather Events**: The species is also threatened by the effects of severe weather events such as droughts and floods. These events can further degrade the mussel's habitat and limit the species' ability to recover.
