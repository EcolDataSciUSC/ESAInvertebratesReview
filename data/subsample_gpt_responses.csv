1,Ptychobranchus subtentus,"Based on the comprehensive Recovery Plan for the Fluted Kidneyshell (Ptychobranchus subtentus) detailed above, various threats to the species are identified and discussed. Ranking these threats from least to most supported by the literature cited within the document requires examining the references for direct mentions of threats and the supporting data or findings regarding Ptychobranchus subtentus.

1. **Least Supported: Disease (Pathogens such as Clinch densovirus 1)** - Although disease was not initially identified as a significant threat at the time of listing, recent occurrences (e.g., annual mussel die-offs in the Clinch River starting in 2016) suggested pathogens or other causal agents could pose a serious threat (Henley et al., 2019; Richard et al., 2020). However, the extent to which disease directly impacts Ptychobranchus subtentus specifically, beyond the general mention in the context of mussel health in the Clinch River, is less documented compared to other threats like habitat degradation or climate change.

2. **Moderately Supported: Climate Change** - The document acknowledges climate change as a likely threat, altering hydrologic cycles and temperature regimes, but also admits the extent or magnitude of this threat has not been quantified. This places climate change as a recognized yet less quantified threat relative to others with direct, cited impacts on the species.

3. **Supported by Direct Mention and Some Details: Habitat Degradation and Fragmentation** - Several sources within the document (USACE 2019; TVA 2020) connect the construction of large impoundments and the resulting habitat fragmentation as a foundational threat that has shaped the current distribution of Ptychobranchus subtentus. This threat is directly tied to historical context and ongoing activity impacts, making it well-supported yet somewhat general in its discussion within the plan.

4. **Most Supported: Specific Habitat Requirements and the Role of Impoundments** - The most supported threat concerns the specific habitat requirements of the Fluted Kidneyshell and how impoundments have rendered habitats unsuitable (Williams et al., 2008; Davis and Layzer, 2012). The detailed discussion on the species’ preference for medium-sized creeks to large rivers with sand and gravel substrates, and how these environments have been altered, provides a clear, well-supported explanation of a critical threat. Additionally, references regarding the species' life history and reproductive requirements offer direct evidence of how habitat changes impact its survival and recovery.

In summary, while each threat to Ptychobranchus subtentus is acknowledged within the document, the degree of literature support varies. Disease and climate change are recognized threats but are somewhat less quantified or specifically tied to Ptychobranchus subtentus outcomes compared to the more extensively supported habitat degradation, fragmentation, and the explicit needs of the species as related to impoundments and habitat alteration.

5,Medionidus simpsonianus,"Based on the text provided, it's clear that the document itself does not directly enumerate or discuss specific threats to the Ochlockonee Moccasinshell (Medionidus simpsonianus). The excerpt focuses primarily on outlining the process of amending the recovery plan for the species, mentioning consultations with experts, reviews, and the sources of data used for the amendment (including conservation strategies, discussions with species experts, and survey data). 

However, without direct mention of specific threats in the provided text, we can infer that the threats identified and ranked in the amendment are likely discussed in the broader referenced literature and sources such as the reports by Holcomb et al. 2015, Pursifull et al. (in prep.), and survey data collected by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in 2017. 

Since the excerpt does not directly cite this information, it's not possible to accurately rank identified threats for Medionidus simpsonianus according to least and most supported by referenced literature in this document. To obtain such rankings, one would need to access and review the full recovery plan amendment, along with the specific referenced sources (Holcomb et al. 2015, Pursifull et al. in prep., and the mentioned survey data) for detailed discussions on the threats facing the species."

9,Cambarus aculabrum,"It seems there was an oversight, as the specific text you're referring to wasn't included in your question. Therefore, I can't provide a direct analysis or ranking of threats to Cambarus aculabrum based on the referenced document.

However, Cambarus aculabrum, often known as a species of crayfish, generally faces several threats across its habitat, typically within the United States. Based on knowledge of crayfish ecology and conservation literature, threats to species like Cambarus aculabrum can usually include:

1. Habitat destruction or modification: This is often the most significant threat to crayfish populations, including urban development, agricultural practices, and dam construction that can alter or eliminate their habitats.

2. Pollution: Water pollution from agricultural runoff, waste discharge, and other contaminant sources can degrade the water quality of their habitat, impacting their survival.

3. Climate change: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect water levels, temperature, and flow, all critical factors for crayfish habitat.

4. Invasive species: The introduction of non-native crayfish species can lead to competition for resources, predation, and sometimes the spread of diseases.

To rank these threats according to least and most supported by referenced literature for Cambarus aculabrum specifically, the actual references in the provided document would be needed. Literature support can vary based on geography, specific environmental impacts studied, and the focus of conservation efforts. Generally, habitat destruction and invasive species are often cited as significant threats in crayfish conservation studies, but the exact ranking would depend on the specific findings and focus of the literature you're referring to. If you can provide excerpts or summary points from the document, I could offer more detail or adjust the response accordingly."

11,Medionidus parvulus,"I'm sorry, but without the specific text or document that outlines the threats to Medionidus parvulus, I cannot directly provide the analysis you're asking for. However, if you have details or key points mentioned regarding the threats to Medionidus parvulus, I can certainly help categorize them based on typical conservation concerns, such as habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, invasive species, and overexploitation. 

Commonly, for freshwater mussels like Medionidus parvulus, the most frequently cited threats often include:
1. Pollution (e.g., agricultural runoff, industrial pollutants)
2. Habitat destruction (e.g., damming, dredging, construction)
3. Invasive species (e.g., competition or predation by non-native species)
4. Climate change (e.g., changes in water temperature, flow regimes)
5. Overexploitation (less common for many mussel species, but can include overharvesting for bait, pearls, or shell material)

To rank these threats accurately according to the least and most supported by referenced literature as per your request, I would need specific details or statements from the document you're referencing. Each of these threats can be supported by empirical studies and conservation assessments, so their ranking for Medionidus parvulus would depend on the content of the document you have. Please let me know if you can share more detailed information or key findings from your document!"

19,Callophrys mossii bayensis,"Based on the detailed information provided in the text, the threats to the San Bruno elfin butterfly (Callophrys mossii bayensis) can be ranked as follows, from most to least supported by the referenced literature:

1. **Habitat Degradation and Loss due to Infrastructure Projects and Private Development:** Although development is not considered an imminent threat due to most habitat being on publicly protected lands, it is still a threat on privately owned habitat (Service 1976; Service 2010). The emphasis on habitat protection in the literature, including spatial data showing protected lands (Service 2010, 2019), underscores the ongoing concern regarding habitat integrity.

2. **Native and Exotic Plant Invasions:** The recovery plan amendment includes concerns about native and exotic plant invasions potentially affecting the habitat (Service 2019). This is critical because habitat integrity directly impacts the availability of host plants for larvae.

3. **Climate Change:** Climate change is noted as a threat with implications that need further investigation, particularly how climate factors influence host plant stages and butterfly phenology (Service 2019). Although the direct impact on Callophrys mossii bayensis is not thoroughly detailed, climate change is acknowledged as a factor influencing ecological dynamics critical to the butterfly's lifecycle.

4. **Parasitism and Predation of Larvae:** These are identified as threats in the 2010 status review (Service 2010). While specific impacts or trends are not detailed in the recent literature, these biological pressures are recognized concerns for maintaining butterfly populations.

5. **Pesticide Use:** Mentioned in the recovery plan amendment (Service 2019), the use of pesticides could affect larval and adult survival. Though not heavily emphasized, it's recognized as a management concern.

6. **Small Population Size and Accidental Damage from Monitoring:** Small population size increases vulnerability to demographic and environmental stochasticity, a concern acknowledged in Services (2010, 2019). Accidental damage during population monitoring, noted in the recovery plan amendment (Service 2019), highlights the sensitivity of the species' habitat and the need for careful conservation practices.

7. **Habitat Loss due to Succession:** The potential for habitat loss due to natural succession is noted but not heavily emphasized in the text. It's an underlying concern that could impact long-term habitat quality and availability (Service 2010).

8. **Poaching:** While listed as a threat in the 2010 status review (Service 2010), there is limited information or emphasis on poaching in the recent documents, suggesting it might not currently be considered a significant concern.

In summary, the threats from habitat degradation and loss due to infrastructure projects and private development are the most supported and detailed in the literature, reflecting the priority concerns for Callophrys mossii bayensis conservation. Other threats, while recognized, are less emphasized or detailed, indicating areas where additional research and targeted management actions could be beneficial."

22,Erinna newcombi,"Based on the text provided, the identified threats to Erinna newcombi (Newcomb's Snail) can be ranked from least supported by referenced literature to most supported as follows:

### Least Supported:
- **Non-native flatworms and other parasites** (Hayes, 2022) - This threat is acknowledged but is noted as under-studied in the text, suggesting limited specific literature support.

### Moderately Supported:
- **Goats (Capra hircus), rats (Rattus sp.), marsh flies, pigs (Sus scrofa), and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana)** (Wood, 2011) - While these threats are recognized, the document details them collectively without specifying the depth of literature support for each, suggesting a moderate level of support.

- **Climate change impacts on stream habitats** (Hayes, 2022) - Increase in drier periods and flooding that could replace native plant species with invasive ones; this threat is detailed with a specific note on how these changes threaten the snail's habitat.

### Most Supported:
- **Predation by the red-crested cardinals (Paroaria coronata)** (Wood, 2017) - This threat is well-documented with an observation of cardinals feeding on freshwater snails along the Hanakoa stream, leading to a significant decline in observed E. newcombi from 50 to none.

- **Invasive plant species** (Wood, 2011) - Detailed as widespread among E. newcombi sub-population locations, indicating a well-supported threat through literature.

### Summary:
The most supported threats, based on the document's referenced literature, are predation by the red-crested cardinals and the presence of invasive plant species at key habitats for E. newcombi. These are followed by moderately supported threats from various animals and climate change impacts, with the least supported threat being non-native flatworms and other parasites due to their under-studied nature."

25,Pleurobema taitianum,"Given the provided text, the threats to Pleurobema taitianum (Southern Combshell) can be ranked according to the evidence presented in the document as follows:

**Identification and Ranking of Threats:**

1. **Recruitment Failure** - Mentioned explicitly for Heavy Pigtoe but indirectly affects the stability and growth potential of Pleurobema taitianum populations. The challenges around propagation, as highlighted in the efforts with Heavy Pigtoe, may reflect broader threats related to successful recruitment in mussels. Therefore, it's indirectly a threat with moderate support in the document due to the association of recruitment issues in mussels generally.

2. **Habitat Degradation and Erosion** - Specifically identified as a historical issue but indicates stabilization in some areas (e.g., parts of the river stabilizing and the species reoccupying degraded lower reaches). It's a well-supported threat given the direct observation and efforts aimed at habitat preservation and improvement.

3. **Natural or Human-induced Catastrophic Events** - Identified as a persistent risk for the surviving population, highlighting the vulnerability of the single population in Mississippi. It's a broadly supported risk as these events could rapidly negate conservation efforts.

4. **Insufficient Evidence of Recruitment** - Directly stated as an absence of clear evidence of recruitment within the single surviving population of Pleurobema taitianum. It's a high concern due to its implications for long-term population viability.

5. **Limited Range and Isolation of the Surviving Population** - While not labelled a ""threat"" per se, the document underscores the vulnerability due to the highly localized and isolated population, making it susceptible to extinction from localized disturbances. The considerable focus on preserving this population and attempting reintroductions elsewhere supports the implicit threat of having all ""eggs in one basket.""

**Ranking Importance:**

- **Most Supported Threats**:
    - **Habitat Degradation and Erosion**: Directly observed and addressed through conservation efforts.
    - **Limited Range and Isolation of the Surviving Population**: Central to the discussion on the species status and conservation measures.
    - **Insufficient Evidence of Recruitment**: Directly impacts the species’ potential for recovery and maintenance of a healthy population.

- **Least Supported Threat**:
    - **Natural or Human-induced Catastrophic Events**: While a potential threat, it's more of a hypothetical risk without specific instances directly affecting Pleurobema taitianum documented in the provided text.
    
- **Moderately Supported Threat**:
    - **Recruitment Failure**: Not directly discussed for Pleurobema taitianum but implied as a concern through the context of similar species and propagation efforts.

The document primarily focuses on the conservation measures and attempts at species recovery, which indirectly underscores the threats these efforts are designed to mitigate. The synthesis and recommendations for future action sections further highlight the perceived threats through the lens of required conservation actions."

28,Alasmidonta atropurpurea,"I'm sorry, but you didn't provide the text containing information on Alasmidonta atropurpurea, which includes detailed threats and the referenced literature. If you could share the relevant portions of the document you're referring to, I can help identify and rank the threats based on the referenced literature provided. Alasmidonta atropurpurea, assuming it refers to a species of concern (likely a mussel given the genus), faces several potential threats like habitat degradation, pollution, invasive species, and climate change, but without the specific text, it's difficult to rank these or other threats accurately."
29,Habroscelimorpha dorsalis dorsalis,Document too long...
30,Antrobia culveri,"Based on the provided text, it’s not possible to directly extract specific detailed information regarding the threats to *Antrobia culveri* or to rank them according to the least and most supported by referenced literature because the body of the text you've shared is composed of placeholder lines without any actual content on threats, studies, or findings related to *Antrobia culveri*. 

However, in a typical scientific or conservation context, threats to a species like *Antrobia culveri* could include habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, disease (such as those caused by pathogens like *Pseudogymnoascus destructans*, which is mentioned and is known to cause White-nose Syndrome in bats), and competition with or predation by invasive species.

If we had detailed content associating each of these threats to *Antrobia culveri* with cited literature, one could expect to see these threats mentioned with varying degrees of support from scientific studies, reports, and assessments, such as in journals like *Conservation Biology*, *Journal of Wildlife Management*, or specific regional conservation and species management symposia proceedings.

To accurately rank threats based on their support in the literature provided, one would need clear mentions of these threats alongside citations or summary findings from various sources indicating the level of research backing each threat. Typically:

- The most supported threats would have multiple references across a variety of high-impact, peer-reviewed scientific journals, symposium proceedings, and authoritative conservation agencies’ reports.
- The least supported threats might only be mentioned anecdotally, in isolated studies, or in more speculative contexts without broad consensus or significant empirical backing.

Since the actual content detailing threats and supporting literature is not provided, I recommend reviewing the specific sections of the references listed (if available in the full text) that directly address findings, discussions, and reviews related to *Antrobia culveri*. This approach would allow one to extract concrete information on threats to the species and their scientific backing, ranking them accordingly."

33,Lampsilis streckeri,"Based on the information provided in your query, there's no specific text given about Lampsilis streckeri, its threats, or any related research. To effectively identify and rank threats to Lampsilis streckeri (a mussel species, assuming from the context) according to their support in literature, I'd need details from the document you're referring to, or at least summaries of findings, conclusions, or direct statements about threats to this species.

However, I can provide an informed guess on the general threats faced by freshwater mussels like Lampsilis streckeri based on known research and conservation literature up to my last update:

1. **Habitat loss and degradation**: This is a significant threat to many freshwater mussel species due to pollution, dam construction, mining, and land development activities that alter water quality and flow.

2. **Climate change**: Changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can affect the habitat and survival of freshwater mussels.

3. **Invasive species**: Invasive species can outcompete native mussels for food, habitat, and can sometimes physically obstruct the native mussels from feeding properly.

4. **Overharvesting**: While not as significant a threat today as in the past, the collection of mussels for their shells or as bycatch in fishing operations can still negatively impact populations.

5. **Pollution**: Chemicals, heavy metals, pesticides, and other pollutants can poison mussels or lead to a decrease in water quality that negatively affects their survival.

Ranking these threats without the specific document’s conclusions or a broader context of research findings is speculative. In general, habitat loss and degradation, along with pollution, tend to be the most documented and supported threats in literature across various freshwater mussel species. Climate change is becoming increasingly recognized as a profound threat as well, but specific impacts and mechanisms may be less documented than those of more immediate physical disturbances. Invasive species can have very significant local impacts, but their overall effect can vary by region and available literature. Overharvesting has historical precedent as a significant threat, but in many places, regulations may have reduced its impact, making it less documented in recent literature compared to the other threats listed.

For an accurate ranking specific to Lampsilis streckeri based on referenced literature, I would recommend reviewing scientific studies, review articles, and conservation reports directly addressing the species. Conservation status reports by organizations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), research articles in peer-reviewed journals, and species recovery plans from governmental wildlife agencies would likely provide the most directly relevant and scientifically supported information."

38,Hesperia dacotae,"Based on the recovery plan for the Dakota Skipper (Hesperia dacotae), the document outlines several primary threats to the species. These threats are derived from the broader context of habitat conservation and management practices necessary to ensure the butterfly's long-term viability. The threats, ranked from least to most supported by referenced literature in the document, are as follows:

1. **Land Management Regimes (Least Supported)**: Management practices such as grazing, haying, or fire, if not appropriately timed or conducted, could degrade habitat quality essential for the survival of the Dakota Skipper. While the plan discusses this as a factor, specific research or literature supporting how each management practice directly impacts the species is less detailed compared to other threats (Section I.B, Section III.B).

2. **Invasive Species**: The encroachment of invasive plant species into native prairie habitats can significantly alter the ecological balance, potentially displacing the native flora upon which the Dakota Skipper depends. While this is identified as a significant threat, the detailed impacts or specific invasive species are not deeply elaborated in terms of direct studies on the Dakota Skipper (Section II, Section III.B).

3. **Pesticides**: Pesticide use, including herbicides, poses a direct and indirect threat to the Dakota Skipper through various mechanisms, including habitat degradation and direct mortality. Research and discussions around the specific effects of pesticides, although a recognized threat, might not encompass extensive literature explicitly focused on the Dakota Skipper but highlight a recognized and supported concern (Section II, Section III.F).

4. **Environmental Stochasticity and Catastrophes**: Variations in environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, along with catastrophic events like droughts, significantly impact the Dakota Skipper's survival. Specific references to studies or literature that model or examine these effects on the Dakota Skipper give substance to this threat, combining both documented cases and theoretical models (Criterion 1, Section I.B).

5. **Habitat Loss, Fragmentation, and Degradation (Most Supported)**: The most emphasized threat throughout the document is the loss, fragmentation, and degradation of native prairie habitats due to human activities, including agriculture, urbanization, and energy development. This threat is well-supported by literature and encompasses a broad range of research studies that are likely referenced throughout the recovery plan document. This includes discussions on the historical range of the species, the importance of native prairie habitats, and specific examples of habitat degradation (Introduction, Section I.B, Section III.A).

It's worth noting that while some threats like land management practices and invasive species are recognized, the most detailed and supported discussions in the plan likely revolve around the direct loss of habitat and the subsequent degradation and fragmentation of remaining prairies. However, without access to the referenced literature list directly, the exact ranking of these threats based on the volume of supporting literature in the document has to be inferred from the narrative's focus and detailed discussions provided."
39,Pleurobema athearni,"Based on the provided document, the identified threats to the Canoe Creek Clubshell (Pleurobema athearni) include:

1. Increased sedimentation and declining water quality attributed to land use within the Big Canoe Creek watershed.
2. Inundation due to impoundments on the Coosa River rendering some stream reaches unable to support the species.
3. An increase in the frequency of severe droughts observed in the recent past and projected to occur in the future.
4. A lack of successful reproduction and recruitment as evidenced by a lack of small size classes observed in the population.

Ranking of threats based on the literature support provided in the document:

**Most Supported Threats:**
1. A lack of successful reproduction and recruitment (supported extensively as a crucial threat impacting the species' ability to rebound from stressors. It's discussed in the context of life history traits and demographic conditions that are resultant of both habitat quality issues and inherent biological characteristics of the species. References to Haag (2012), Haag (2013), and Haag and Staton (2003) provide evidence on the reproductive challenges and survival rates for mussel species which would apply to Pleurobema athearni).
2. Increased sedimentation and declining water quality (mentioned directly as contributing to the status of the species and tied to land use changes within the watershed, implicating it as a significant threat to the habitat requirements necessary for the species' survival. While the specific effect on Pleurobema athearni is not detailed extensively with quantitative analysis, the correlation between habitat degradation and mussel survival is well-established in conservation literature).

**Least Supported Threats:**
3. Inundation due to impoundments on the Coosa River (identified as a threat, but the supporting data or literature specific to Pleurobema athearni's response to this condition is not detailed within the excerpt. However, the general adverse impact of habitat alteration on freshwater mussels is acknowledged in conservation science).
4. Increased frequency of severe droughts (projected impacts of climate change, such as drought frequency, are mentioned as anticipated to have substantial effects on the species. Although supported by ongoing observations and projections, detailed studies or data specific to how Pleurobema athearni has been or will be affected by these drought conditions are not provided, making it less supported in relation to the direct evidence cited for other threats).

In summary, threats related to reproductive challenges and habitat degradation due to sedimentation and water quality are the most supported by the referenced literature and data within the document. In contrast, threats associated with impoundments and future drought conditions are acknowledged but are less directly supported with specific studies or data on Pleurobema athearni."

42,Fusconaia cor,"Given the content of the provided document, the identified threats to **Fusconaia cor (Shiny Pigtoe)**, ranked from least supported to most supported by the referenced literature within this document, are as follows:

1. **Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes**:
   - Least supported. The document specifically mentions that overutilization was not considered a limiting factor in the shiny pigtoe's recovery plan and there is no new information indicating change.

2. **Disease or Predation**:
   - Somewhat supported. Predation (e.g., by muskrats) and disease (e.g., potential trematode infestations) are mentioned as possible factors affecting the species. However, the document also notes that virtually nothing is known about mussel diseases, making this a speculative threat.

3. **Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms**:
   - Moderately supported. The document points out the limited efficacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to protect the species and its habitat from various activities (e.g., development, pollution) and the inadequacy of state and local regulations in providing protection.

4. **Genetic Isolation and Small Population Size**:
   - Well-supported with emerging concern. The document discusses the threats associated with small, isolated populations including increased susceptibility to stochastic events, limited genetic variation, and potential inbreeding depression.

5. **Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence**:
   - Very well supported. This category encompasses various anthropogenic stressors including coal mining, urbanization, agriculture, and toxic chemical spills. The role of coal mining and associated pollutants is especially highlighted as having significantly affected the species’ habitat in the Clinch and Powell Rivers.

6. **Habitat Destruction and Modification**:
   - Most supported and thoroughly discussed. The threats include impoundments that have led to the loss of suitable habitat, episodic and chronic toxic spills, altered flow conditions from dams, and changes caused by surface runoff from various land uses. The document explicitly states these factors as primary threats that remain similar to their status during the species' initial listing and throughout its recovery plan development.

The ranking above aligns threats according to the level of support and detail provided in the document, showcasing a range from general mentions to well-documented and thoroughly analyzed threats to Fusconaia cor's existence and recovery potential."

46,Rhadine exilis,"Given the text provided, the identified threats to Rhadine exilis and their literature support can be summarized and ranked as follows:

1. **Habitat Destruction/Deterioration due to Construction and Development**: This threat is primarily supported by discussions in the document regarding the critical need for habitat preservation and management to maintain the species' long-term survival. The potential for imminent development in undeveloped areas further supports this threat (Sections 2.2.3 and 4.0).
   
2. **Contamination from Various Sources**: Supported by the initial list of threats that includes septic effluent, sewer leaks, runoff, pesticides, and other sources as contributing to habitat destruction or deterioration (Section 1.3).

3. **Competition and Predation by Red-Imported Fire Ants (RIFA)**: Explicitly mentioned as a threat, with actions recommended for controlling RIFA to ensure species survival, indicating literature support within the recovery actions section (Sections 1.3 and 4.0).

4. **Climate Change**: Mentioned as a threat that was not identified at the time of the original listing, highlighting its emergence based on new assessments and indicating some level of literature support albeit with an acknowledgment of insufficient certainty (Section 2.3).

5. **Vandalism**: Listed among the initial threats affecting these species. However, there's minimal detailed discussion on this threat in the remainder of the document, suggesting it is a recognized but less supported threat in the context of this document compared to others (Section 1.3).

6. **Loss of Impermeable Cover**: Implicit under habitat destruction but mentioned specifically in the threats section. The specific impacts of losing impermeable cover are not detailed, indicating it is a recognized but less detailed threat in this document (Sections 1.3).

7. **Filling of Caves and Karst Features**: Like the loss of impermeable cover, this threat is mentioned initially but is not extensively supported or detailed through the review process (Section 1.3).

From least to most supported by literature in this document:
- Filling of caves and karst features
- Loss of impermeable cover
- Vandalism
- Climate change
- Competition and predation by RIFA
- Contamination from various sources
- Habitat destruction/deterioration due to construction and development

This ranking is based on the extent of discussion, the presence of recovery actions addressing the threat, and the direct mention as primary threats to the species' survival within the provided document sections."
47,Erinna newcombi,"Based on the document, the threats to Erinna newcombi (Newcomb's Snail) can be ranked according to the extent to which they are supported by the referenced literature. The following is an analysis of each threat and its corresponding references, ranked from least to most supported:

1. **Stochastic events - Hurricane mortality and reduced viability**: This threat is specifically mentioned with reference to the impacts of Hurricane Iniki as assessed by Polhemus in 1993. While it is a direct account, the specific focus on hurricanes provides a narrower scope of evidence compared to other more broadly discussed threats. (**Moderately Supported**)

2. **Altered hydrology**: This threat encompasses various human-induced changes in water systems, including agricultural development, stream diversion, dewatering aquifers, vertical wells, channelization, and hydroelectric power. The references from USFWS (2000, 2006) and communications from Levin (2011a, b) as well as studies by Polhemus and Asquith (1996) provide substantial evidence of the threat to the species' habitat from altered hydrology, making it among the better-documented threats. (**Well Supported**)

3. **Landslides and flooding - loss or degradation of habitat**: This threat is cited with references to research from the mid-1980s through to 2000 (Jones et al., 1984; Polhemus, 1993; USFWS, 2000, 2006). While the basis is well-supported through historical accounts of specific events (like the Olokele rock avalanche and Hurricane Iniki), it can be considered slightly less pervasive in the literature compared to the systemic issue of altered hydrology, mainly because these are event-specific occurrences. However, it's clearly a significant and well-cited concern. (**Well Supported**)

4. **Invasive species**: Though no specific references from the document directly support threats from invasive species within the new threats section, invasive species competition is acknowledged in the document under ongoing threats and conservation efforts. Given that management actions against non-native predators and competitors have been deemed necessary, it implies a well-understood issue, albeit less directly supported by the new references provided for other threats. (**Moderately Supported**)

5. **Climate change**: Mentioned as a threat but without specific literature backing in the New Threats section, it's broadly understood within the conservation community to be a pressing concern for many species. However, within the context of this document, it's not given the same level of direct reference support as altered hydrology or landslide/flooding. (**Least Supported**)

Given the analysis above, **altered hydrology** stands as the most supported threat in terms of referenced literature, closely followed by **landslides and flooding**. Both are deeply interconnected with the species' aquatic habitat and have multiple studies and reports backing their impact assessment. **Stochastic events** related to hurricanes have a dedicated but narrower focus. **Invasive species**, while clearly acknowledged as a threat, lacks the new specific reference support seen in the discussion of hydrology and landslide/flooding threats within the given text. **Climate change**, although one of the universally acknowledged threats to biodiversity, has the least direct support within the context of this document's new threats analysis."

56,Polyphylla barbata,"Based on the document provided, the identified threats for Polyphylla barbata (Mount Hermon June beetle) are as follows, ranked according to least and most supported by referenced literature in the document:

### Least Supported
1. **Over-collection and Pesticides**: These were considered additional threats at the time of listing but are currently not viewed as significant threats. No new supporting literature or evidence is mentioned regarding these factors affecting Polyphylla barbata directly.

2. **Predation**: Though not extensively supported, there is some mention of predation (e.g., by bats) possibly affecting MHJB, somewhat supported but not considered a large-scale threat.

3. **Agricultural Conversion**: Previously considered a minor threat, and while agricultural conversion to vineyards is occurring, it's not actively mentioned as a significant ongoing threat to Polyphylla barbata.

4. **Urban Development**: Once deemed a primary threat, its intensity has reportedly reduced over the years. The residual effects of past urban development contribute to habitat fragmentation and degradation but are not actively ongoing on a large scale.

5. **Recreational Use**: It's mentioned as a threat due to habitat disturbance, but efforts to control access (e.g., at Quail Hollow Quarry) have somewhat mitigated its impact.

### Most Supported
6. **Climate Change**: Considered a significant threat due to the potential disruption to life history traits and inability of the species to migrate or adapt quickly to changes. The document highlights the need for further study but acknowledges probable negative effects due to temperature increases, extreme weather events, drought, and wildfire.

7. **Sand Mining**: Although reduced and some areas being restored, past sand mining activities have left a lasting impact on habitat fragmentation and degradation, making it unsuitable for Polyphylla barbata. The document highlights efforts towards habitat restoration.

8. **Altered Fire Regimes/Forest or Chaparral Succession**: Identified as the predominant threat for not just Polyphylla barbata but also the Zayante band-winged grasshopper. Fire suppression/exclusion leads to habitat type conversion, reducing the amount of open canopy and exposed sandy soil essential for the beetle's lifecycle. Habitat management actions like prescribed burns are suggested to counteract these effects.

### Conclusion
The document extensively supports altered fire regimes/forest or chaparral succession and climate change as significant ongoing threats to Polyphylla barbata, with detailed mentions of the specific impacts and the need for targeted management and further research. The mentioned restoration efforts, including those to mitigate the effects of sand mining, also indicate substantial support within the literature for addressing these threats. In contrast, threats like over-collection, pesticides, predation, agricultural conversion, urban development, and recreational use are less supported, with fewer details and mitigation measures discussed."

64,Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis,"Based on the provided document, the threats to the Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis (Palos Verdes blue butterfly) are identified as follows (listed from least to most supported by the referenced literature):

1. **Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes (Factor B)**: This threat is mentioned as not applicable since at the time of listing and subsequently, substantial impacts from collectors have not been observed. Additionally, research activities are regulated through permits.

2. **Disease or Predation (Factor C)**: This threat is also considered not significantly applicable. There was a mention of potential predation by earwigs on larval and egg stages during habitat restoration efforts, but it's not considered a significant ongoing threat.

3. **Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms (Factor D)**: Several regulatory mechanisms are discussed, including the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and particularly the Endangered Species Act, which provides substantial protections. While some state and federal acts offer indirect protection, the primary mechanism for conservation, according to the summary, is through the Endangered Species Act itself. This acknowledges that while there are some weaknesses or limitations in regulatory mechanisms, they are in place and offer various degrees of protection.

4. **Small population size and isolation (part of Factor E)**: Identified as a major concern due to the implications for genetic diversity, inbreeding, and vulnerability to stochastic events. This issue is supported by conservation biology principles regarding the vulnerabilities of small, isolated populations to extinction risks.

5. **Habitat destruction, modification, or curtailment (Factor A)**: Extensively discussed, including past impacts through residential and commercial development, non-native weed invasion, and ongoing and potential threats to habitat within the butterfly's range. The document provides detailed information on the efforts undertaken to conserve and restore habitat, highlighting ongoing risks yet acknowledging conservation efforts that mitigate some of these threats.

6. **Other factors (Part of Factor E)**: Mentioned in conjunction with habitat destruction in the historical context of the listing decision, like weed control practices and non-native plant invasion, which were initially considered under ""other factors"" but have later been addressed more thoroughly under habitat modification and destruction. This categorization includes management efforts that have begun to address these threats, albeit recognizing ongoing challenges.

In conclusion, habitat destruction and modification (Factor A) are the most supported and discussed threats in the document, detailing both historical impacts and ongoing conservation efforts. Small population size and isolation is also well-supported, particularly in terms of the theoretical and practical risks it poses to the species. Regulatory mechanisms (Factor D), disease or predation (Factor C), and overutilization (Factor B) receive various levels of attention, acknowledging potential issues but also noting mitigative measures in place or the lesser extent of these concerns."

67,Faxonius quadruncus,"The identified threats to *Faxonius quadruncus* are invasion by the Woodland Crayfish (*Faxonius hylas*) and issues stemming from heavy metal contamination and sedimentation in its habitat. Based on the information provided in this document, here’s a ranking of these threats from the least to most supported by referenced literature:

1. **Sedimentation**: This threat is discussed primarily within the context of its potential to impact crayfish habitat by covering rocks and cavities used for refuge, thus potentially facilitating displacement by competing species such as the Woodland Crayfish. Sedimentation could reduce habitat quality, but the specific impacts on *Faxonius quadruncus* are implied rather than detailed with extensive research citations.

2. **Heavy Metal Contamination**: This issue is supported by references discussing the lingering effects of historic lead mining activities in the region, which have left behind contamination that impacts aquatic biota, including crayfish. Studies cited like Allert et al. (2008, 2009, 2012, 2013) demonstrate the adverse effects of mining-derived metals on crayfish in other Missouri areas, which likely extend to *Faxonius quadruncus*, although direct references to this species in the context of heavy metal exposure are limited within this outline.

3. **Invasion by the Woodland Crayfish (*Faxonius hylas*)**: The threat posed by the invasive Woodland Crayfish is the most extensively referenced in this document. It covers historical spread, documented impacts on *Faxonius quadruncus* and native crayfish populations, studies on the mechanisms of displacement (potentially through hybridization as suggested by Fetzner et al. 2016), and the spatial extent of invasion with specific stream kilometers affected. A series of studies (DiStefano et al. 2008a, 2008b, 2011; Fetzner and DiStefano 2008; Westhoff 2011) directly discuss the interactions between the Woodland Crayfish and native species, offering detailed insight into the ecological dynamics, genetic analysis, and conservation challenges posed by this invasive species.

In conclusion, invasion by the Woodland Crayfish is substantiated as the principal threat to *Faxonius quadruncus* with a strong foundation in the referenced literature within this document. Heavy metal contamination and sedimentation are also recognized as significant concerns but have a comparatively weaker direct research focus on *Faxonius quadruncus*."

79,Elaphrus viridis,"Based on the provided text, the identified threats to the **Delta green ground beetle (*Elaphrus viridis*)** are, in order of mention and with additional insights towards their support as inferred from the document:

1. **Small population size**: Mentioned as a primary threat at the time of listing, with continued lack of population trends or estimates indicating ongoing concern (indirectly supported).

2. **Limited range and habitat modification and destruction, primarily due to agricultural development and potential future development**: Initially a primary threat, with some mitigation through land preservation but ongoing issues due to non-protected occurrences and potential development impacts (well-supported).

3. **Non-native species**: Highlighted in the review without significant evidence present in this document directly linking to impacts on the beetle, but mentioned as a persistent issue (mentioned but not detailed).

4. **Climate change**: Identified as a continuing threat, though specific impacts on the beetle's habitat or lifecycle are not detailed within the text (mentioned but not detailed).

5. **Utility maintenance, repair, and transmission and distribution activities**: Suggested as threats, with some potential for habitat removal and temporary impact, but with mitigation measures like habitat acquisition for impacts offset (indirectly supported with specifics on anticipated impacts and mitigation).

6. **Highway expansion**: Described as having been addressed through consultation and compensation mechanisms, thus reducing immediate concern but historically a threat (previously well-supported, now mitigated).

7. **Illegal trespass and dumping of trash on conservation properties**: Noted since the last review, indicating an emerging or newly acknowledged threat (specifically noted, which suggests direct observation or reported incidents).

8. **Wastewater sludge application**: Mentioned in previous assessments but stated to have no evidence affecting the species in the current review (mentioned but effectively dismissed as a current threat).

In summary, the threats from **limited range/habitat modification due to development** and **non-protected occurrences** appear to be the most supported and concerning, referencing direct measures and specific instances impacting the species. In contrast, threats like **non-native species** and **climate change** are acknowledged but are less detailed in their direct impacts on the *Elaphrus viridis*, making them less substantiated in this specific document. The threat related to **wastewater sludge application** appears to be the least supported in the current context, essentially being dismissed as a concern based on the latest information."

84,Epioblasma obliquata,"Based on the extensive document provided, the identified threats to *Epioblasma obliquata obliquata* (also known as the purple cat's paw pearlymussel) include habitat degradation, the impacts of climate change, lack of genetic diversity, and possibly competition with or predation by invasive species such as the Asian clam (*Corbicula fluminea*). Here's a breakdown and ranking of these threats based on the support found in the document:

1. **Habitat Degradation**: This threat is the most documented and discussed throughout the review. Factors contributing to habitat degradation include agricultural activities leading to water quality degradation, oil and gas extraction activities, and the physical modification of river systems through dams. Efforts like dam removal are mentioned as measures to restore habitat, indicating the significant impact habitat degradation has on the species.

2. **Climate Change**: Climate change is recognized as a potential threat that could lead to alterations in water temperature and hydrology, which may adversely affect *Epioblasma obliquata obliquata*. While the specific impacts on the species are unknown, the general expected changes in climate, such as warmer temperatures and more extreme weather events, are likely to impact freshwater ecosystems and, by extension, the species.

3. **Lack of Genetic Diversity**: The document refers to genetic studies indicating low genetic variation within the population in Killbuck Creek, suggesting the population has gone through a recent bottleneck. Low genetic diversity may reduce the species' ability to adapt to environmental changes and thus represents a significant threat.

4. **Competition with or Predation by Invasive Species**: The review mentions the Asian clam's presence in the species' habitat. While not extensively detailed regarding its impact on *Epioblasma obliquata obliquata*, invasive species generally pose threats to native mussels by competing for resources or directly preying on them. Given the less frequent mention and less direct evidence of impact, this threat is ranked lower.

In summary, the ranking from most to least supported threats in the document is as follows: 

1. Habitat Degradation
2. Climate Change
3. Lack of Genetic Diversity
4. Competition with or Predation by Invasive Species

This ranking is based on the detail and frequency of mentions within the document, indicating the level of concern and evidence supporting each threat to *Epioblasma obliquata obliquata*."

87,Medionidus walkeri,"It seems like you intended to include a specific text for analysis, but it appears the text didn't come through in your question. To accurately identify and rank the threats to Medionidus walkeri (assuming it's a species of interest, potentially a mollusk or specifically a freshwater mussel, given the context), I would need specific details from the document you're referring to.

However, although I cannot directly analyze the document you've mentioned due to the missing text, I can provide some general insights into common threats faced by mussels, including those like Medionidus walkeri, based on existing environmental and conservation literature up to my last knowledge update.

1. **Habitat Destruction and Alteration:** Human activities like dam construction, dredging, and the modification of rivers can lead to significant habitat loss or degradation for freshwater mussels. This likely ranks high as a threat because it directly impacts the physical spaces these organisms inhabit.

2. **Pollution:** Chemicals from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and urban runoff can contaminate water bodies, posing a threat to mussel species by affecting their health and the quality of the water and sediment they depend on.

3. **Climate Change:** Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect river and stream flows, potentially leading to habitat unsuitability for many species. While this threat is increasingly recognized in the literature, the direct effects on specific species like Medionidus walkeri may vary and not always be the focus of extensive studies.

4. **Invasive Species:** The introduction of non-native species into aquatic ecosystems can disrupt local food webs and compete with native mussels for food and space, often without the controls (predators, disease) present in their native habitats.

5ips. **Disease and Parasitism:** While diseases and parasites are natural controlling factors for mussel populations, changes in environmental conditions can exacerbate these issues. The impact of diseases and parasitism might not be as extensively documented in the literature specific to Medionidus walkeri but is acknowledged for freshwater mussels in general.

6. **Overharvesting:** If Medionidus walkeri is of economic importance, either commercially or as a subsistence resource, overharvesting could be a significant threat. However, this might be less documented in academic literature compared to habitat destruction or pollution.

To specifically rank these threats for Medionidus walkeri, the document you're referring to would need to be examined. Generally, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change are often the most extensively supported threats in environmental conservation literature for freshwater species, including mussels."
88,Drosophila aglaia,"From the provided document, threats to Drosophila aglaia are identified and ranked as follows based on the referenced literature:

1. **Predation and Competition**: Predation by nonnative insects such as ants and yellowjacket wasps at all life stages, and resource competition from nonnative tipulid flies, are grave threats. This threat is well-supported through citations from multiple sources including Howarth and Medeiros (1989), Howarth and Ramsay (1991), and Howarth et al. (2001).

2. **Habitat Degradation/Modification**: The destruction, modification, or curtailing of its habitat or range due to ongoing habitat degradation is significantly highlighted. Particularly, the threat from invasive plants like Psidium cattleianum and Clidemia hirta, which further degrade the suitable habitat through competition, displacement, and increased wildfire risk. These threats are detailed through citations like Cuddihy and Stone (1990) and various reports from Kishinami (2001) and the Science Panel (2005).

3. **Inadequate Regulatory Mechanisms**: Regulatory mechanisms are described as inadequate for thorough protection of the species, particularly quarantine regulations pertaining to the prevention of accidentally introduced arthropods and the augmentation and introduction of biological control agents in Hawaii.

4. **Climate Change**: The potential impacts of climate change on the life cycle characteristics of D. aglaia and the range of its host plants are mentioned, although current climate change analyses in the Pacific Islands lack sufficient spatial resolution to make predictions on impacts to this species. Future climate modeling efforts are referenced to resolve these spatial limitations.

5. **Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes**: Overutilization is expressly noted not to be a known threat to this species.

6. **Disease**: Similar to overutilization, disease is specifically stated not to be a known threat to Hawaiian picture-wing flies.

The ranking above goes from the most supported threats (Predation and Competition, Habitat Degradation/Modification) with multiple references and citations in the document, down to threats that are either not considered applicable to D. aglaia (Overutilization and Disease) or are less detailed in terms of immediate impacts and current research (Inadequate Regulatory Mechanisms, Climate Change)."

91,Alasmidonta raveneliana,"Based on the detailed Status Review document for the Appalachian Elktoe (Alasmidonta raveneliana), the identified threats to the species can be summarized and ranked from least supported to most supported by the provided references and literature in the document:

1. **Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes (Factor B)**
   - Least supported: It is mentioned that the Appalachian Elktoe does not have any recognized commercial value and there does not appear to be a significant threat from overutilization of the species.

2. **Disease or Predation (Factor C)**
   - While disease and predation on freshwater mussels, including the Appalachian Elktoe, are topics of study, there is no conclusive evidence provided that diseases are a primary factor in observed population declines. Predation by mammals like muskrats, mink, or otters is acknowledged but seems to be a minor effect on the population.

3. **Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms (Factor D)**
   - This threat is more widely supported in the text, noting that present regulatory mechanisms at both federal and state levels are inadequate to ensure the continued existence of the species. It acknowledges that many activities contributing to erosion and turbidity are not adequately monitored for compliance.

4. **Other manmade factors affecting the species' continued existence (Factor E)**
   - Geographic and demographic isolation due to human-mediated factors, lack of gene flow between populations, and habitat alteration are significant threats identified in this category, making it one of the more critical and well-supported threats discussed.

5. **The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range (Factor A)**
   - Most supported: The document extensively discusses the threats of habitat degradation due to siltation, other pollutants from poor land use practices, toxic discharges, and impacts of land disturbance anywhere within the watershed. These threats are associated with the declines in populations and are cited as the primary factors leading to the species being listed as endangered. It is heavily supported with references and examples of declines in specific populations (e.g., Little Tennessee River, South Toe River, Cane River, North Toe River populations), indicating the broad and significant impact of these threats.

In summary, the destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat (Factor A) is the most supported threat in the document, with inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms (Factor D) and other manmade factors (Factor E) also being significant but slightly less extensively documented. Disease or predation (Factor C) and overutilization for various purposes (Factor B) are considered threats but are the least supported by the referenced literature within this document."
92,Epioblasma metastriata,"Based on the text provided, there are no specific threats explicitly ranked for *Epioblasma metastriata* (Upland Combshell). The document primarily discusses the methodology used in the review, the historical status, the presumed extinction, and the survey efforts done to locate these species. There is a general mention of decline, habitat loss and fragmentation, population isolation, and impacts on their habitats, but these are not directly ranked or explicitly tied to *Epioblasma metastriata* in a way that allows for a clear ranking of threats based on referenced literature within this document.

In the absence of specific, detailed threats clearly outlined and ranked for *Epioblastma metastriata*, it's not possible to provide a ranking based on the referenced literature in this document. The document instead focuses on the fact that despite extensive surveys, no living individuals or even fresh-dead specimens of the species have been found, leading to its classification as presumed extinct. This implies that the greatest and most critical threat to the species is its potential extinction, beyond specific factors such as habitat loss, predation, disease, or pollution, which are common threats to mussel species but are not detailed in this document."
93,Palaemonias alabamae,"It appears there was an issue retrieving the text you are referring to regarding threats to Palaemonias alabamae (the Alabama Cave Shrimp). Without the original document or text provided, it's challenging to directly answer your question. Palaemonias alabamae is an endangered species native to cave systems in Alabama, USA, and understanding the threats it faces is crucial for its conservation.

Generally, for species like the Alabama Cave Shrimp, the most common threats include:

1. **Habitat Destruction and Alteration**: Changes to the cave environments, such as construction, mining, or other land use changes that affect the water table or water quality within these caves can be significantly harmful.
   
2. **Water Pollution**: Pollution stemming from agricultural runoff, waste water discharges, and other contaminant sources can significantly impact the water quality in the cave systems where these shrimp live.

3. **Climate Change**: Alterations in water availability and temperature could potentially affect cave ecosystems, though the specific impact on Palaemonias alabamae would need to be supported by scientific studies.

4. **Human Disturbance**: Direct human disturbance of cave habitats through recreational caving activities or vandalism can destroy or degrade habitats necessary for the survival of cave-dwelling species.

Without the specific literature references from the document you're mentioning, it's difficult to precisely rank these threats in terms of their support from the referenced literature. Each of these threats, however, has been noted in conservation literature as significant for various cave-dwelling species, including cave shrimps. For the most accurate information tailored to Palaemonias alabamae, consulting specific research studies, the IUCN Red List, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recovery plans and assessments for this species would provide the best insight into the most pressing threats and their rankings based on empirical evidence."
94,Euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti,"Based on the extensive document provided, the identified *primary threats* to the **Euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti** (Sacramento Mountains Checkerspot Butterfly) are:

1. **Altered wildfire regimes**
2. **Climate change**
3. **Incompatible grazing**
4. **Invasive plants**
5. **Recreation**

**Ranking of threats based on literature support in the document:**

1. **Climate Change** - This threat is heavily supported by the document, especially given the discussion on how changes in temperature and precipitation, attributable to climate change, can result in phenological mismatches that significantly impact the butterfly. The effects of climate change, such as increased severity and frequency of droughts, have been highlighted as contributing to the species' decline.

2. **Altered Wildfire Regimes** - This is well-documented as a significant threat to the SMCB, particularly in terms of habitat modification, which directly affects the butterfly's survival by altering the vegetation structure and composition critical for its lifecycle.

3. **Incompatible Grazing** - Grazing is identified as a primary threat. The direct impact of grazing on host plants and habitat structure is highlighted, suggesting that current grazing practices are not compatible with the butterfly's survival needs.

4. **Recreation** - This threat is supported by references to human disturbances, including direct habitat degradation from recreational activities. While it is mentioned as a primary threat, the specific impacts (e.g., trampling of host plants and butterfly habitats) are less detailed compared to climate change and wildfire regime alterations.

5. **Invasive Plants** - The threat from invasive plants is supported in the document, particularly in the context of habitat degradation and competition with native host plants critical for the butterfly's lifecycle. However, compared to the more immediate and direct impacts of climate change, altered wildfire regimes, and incompatible grazing, the threat from invasive plants seems to be slightly lesser-detailed, indicating potentially a lower rank in terms of immediate literature support within this document.

**Secondary factors** like disease, parasitism, predation, and anthropogenic development were mentioned but not detailed extensively, implying that while they are recognized as threats, they have not been as prominently supported or detailed in the literature outlined in this document compared to the primary factors listed."

96,Palaemonias ganteri,"Given the extensive text provided from the Kentucky Cave Shrimp (Palaemonias ganteri) 5-Year Review document, the identified threats to Palaemonias ganteri, based on the information available, are as follows, ranked from least to most supported by the referenced literature in the document:

### **Least Supported Threats:**

1. **Disease or Predation**: There is mention of rainbow trout presence in the same systems as the Kentucky cave shrimp but no evidence suggesting trout predation is a threat. Furthermore, no information indicates that disease poses a significant risk to the species.

2. **Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes**: It is clearly stated that the Kentucky cave shrimp is not utilized for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, making this a non-threat according to the document.

### **Moderately Supported Threats:**

3. **Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence**: This includes low relative abundance, restricted distribution making them vulnerable to contamination from toxic chemical spills, habitat modification, and natural catastrophic changes (flood scour, drought). It also covers potential implications from climate change, like altered water temperatures and quality, though no species-specific studies are mentioned.

4. **Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms**: The inadequacy of regulatory mechanisms to fully protect the species from groundwater contamination is acknowledged. Although some protection is provided within Mammoth Cave National Park and under various environmental laws, the document states that existing regulations have not been adequate to prevent impacts from contamination.

### **Most Supported Threats:**

5. **Habitat or Range Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment**: The primary threat identified is groundwater contamination via human-related activities. The karst terrain of the shrimp's habitat allows pollutants to quickly enter the groundwater systems, adversely affecting the species. Despite some protections in place, there is no expectation that this threat will be entirely eliminated in the future, especially because a significant portion of the occupied groundwater basin acreage occurs outside Mammoth Cave National Park, where the shrimp is more vulnerable to sources of contamination.

In summary, threats from disease or predation and overutilization are considered minimal or non-existent. Climate change, potential genetic isolation, and the inadequacy of regulatory mechanisms to protect against habitat contamination are of moderate concern, with the most significant and supported threat being the direct destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat and range due to groundwater contamination linked to human activities."
97,Streptocephalus woottoni,"Based on the text provided from the Recovery Plan for Vernal Pools of Southern California, the identified threats for Streptocephalus woottoni, assuming it is covered under the same criteria as the species explicitly mentioned (Eryngium aristulatum var. parishii, Pogogyne abramsii, Pogogyne nudiuscula, Orcuttia californica, and the Riverside and San Diego fairy shrimp), can be inferred and ranked according to the documented threats listed. However, it's essential to note that Streptocephalus woottoni (Riverside fairy shrimp) is directly mentioned under the umbrella of species the recovery plan appears to be addressing, so the threats to its survival would be consistent with the threats listed for the other species. Direct references to Streptocephalus woottoni itself are not provided in the passage, so the following general threats to taxa covered by the plan are assessed for their relevance to Streptocephalus woottoni:

1. **Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of their habitat or range**: This threat encompasses the impact on the vernal pool habitats essential for the species within the plan, including construction, development, pollution, and changes in land use. This is a primary concern as vernal pools are critical for the life cycle of Streptocephalus woottoni.

2. **Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms**: This includes insufficient legal and regulatory frameworks to protect the species and their habitats from degradation and destruction. This threat reflects concerns about whether current laws sufficiently protect these species and their environments from harm.

3. **Other natural and manmade factors affecting their continued existence**: This broadly encompasses a range of factors, including climate change, invasive species, pollution, and changes in water quality or hydrology. These factors are more diffuse and varied in their impacts but are significant in contributing to the overall risk profile for the species.

4. **Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes**: While potentially less of a direct concern for Streptocephalus woottoni specifically, depending on its appeal for such uses, overutilization can pose a threat to populations by causing direct removal or disturbance to individuals or habitats.

5. **Disease or predation**: Although this is a valid concern for any biological population, the text does not provide specific evidence or literature support indicating that disease or preditation is a significant threat compared to habitat destruction or inadequacies in regulatory protection. 

Based on the information provided, the ranking from most to least supported by the referenced literature would be:

1. Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of their habitat or range
2. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms
3. Other natural and manmade factors affecting their continued existence
4. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes
5. Disease or predation

This ranking is based on the inferred significance of each threat to the survival of Streptocephalus woottoni and similar taxa as indicated within the scope of the recovery plan and the broader challenges faced by species residing in vernal pool ecosystems. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that specific studies or literature on Streptocephalus woottoni may illuminate further nuances in these threat assessments."
